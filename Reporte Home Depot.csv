{panel:bgColor=#e3fcef}
*Acceptance Criteria*

+Run validation prior to opening modal+
GIVEN I have selected multiple products

This is a big one. There is a massive amount of quoting logic directly in this material list tab component. We need to move this to the proper place, our quoteFlow component in external-candidate-components.

This will be many subtasks to tackle all the different pieces.
{panel}

{panel:bgColor=#e3fcef}
The overall goal for each of these tasks is to extract each of these pieces of code into the proper place inside of our {{quoteFlow}} sections. Group them as you see fit, inside the component folder they are used in or a shared area if they are reused.

Add unit test coverage wherever possible
{panel}

*Notes*

Should be either one person or pair programming. Each subtask should be it’s own PR with unit test coverage.

{panel}

{panel:bgColor=#fffae6}
*Dev Notes*

Should be able to use the standard function for displaying the discounted price that’s already in use for local and online skus.

As the quantity changes, we make another call to the pricing API to get proper pricing (that API will apply the bulk pricing if applicable). _Note: store/online api will differ from qc api._

We’ll need to track if the new price we’re getting back changes the unit price up or down in order to display the appropriate messaging.

{panel}

{panel:bgColor=#fffae6}
*Dev Notes*

-Materials list has this logic already. Per Bashar, they are using the following logic:- 
-”when the calling this endpoint /SearchNav/model with the new zipcode/store, if we get an error or the response is empty or if response fulfillment section is empty then we show the message as item not available.”-

-Look at fulfillment response to see if it’s empty for the store, but available for online, then move to online.-

*Note: if a Local SKU has 0 available in stock and 0 available for delivery, but is still carried by the store, the SKU should remain as a store SKU and should NOT move to the online bucket.*

{color:#ff5630}*_UPDATE TO LOGIC: Look for warning field as a result of fulfillment endpoint that says item no longer carried in store (coming from Orchestration layer)._*{color}

AND there will be a warning message above the item in the table stating “Maximum of Y per order. Your quantity has been updated.” where Y = the maximum
AND the plus button will be disabled so the user cannot choose a quantity above the maximum 


+Changing Quantity+
GIVEN I am on the product summary page
WHEN I update the quantity of a product
THEN the validation will be run before proceeding to the next step to ensure I’m still within the acceptable range (i.e., at minimum or above / at maximum or below)


+Qty change outside min/max+
Use native qty picker functionality to display an error (only when user is typing into qty field)

+No min/max value returned+
Use existing range of 1-9999
{panel}

{panel:bgColor=#fffae6}
*Dev Notes*

* QC Bridge endpoint should provide min/max for each product by vendor

Overview: The Projects team is updating their GET response to include user information for quoting (with userID). For E2E testing phase, which is now, they are pre-seeding data in their tables for some test Projects with some users. We will be fetching this information from the Project Details and using that in creating a quote. PA Orch will also accept optional request fields from us for the accountID and the userID.
In the future we will leverage CCUI to make this selection and persist it.

* Account ID and the current User ID from Project Details are loading into a context or state for the Add To Quote components can leverage.
* User ID and Account ID are passed to the orchestration layer in addition to the other parameters listing in the document below.

Ensure we are passing *Customer User ID* in addition to SVOCID, products, fulfillment, store, associate ID, etc. 
{panel}

{panel:bgColor=#eae6ff}
*Implementation details*

On the Project Material List page, we only have visibility to the project ID. The corresponding code file is {{materialLists.tsx}}. This is under the Project Dashboard context.

* IMPORTANT task is to change this line in the {{materialLists.tsx}} → 
{noformat}  const [listProcessedState, setListProcessedState] = useState<MaterialListPreProcessed | undefined>();

  // change type in useState to ProjectListPreProcessed | undefined{noformat}
* On this page we need to call this [API|https://proprojects-main-mci.np-pro-project.gcp.homedepot.com/webjars/swagger-ui/index.html?urls.primaryName=V1#/Projects%20discovery/getProjectById] to retrieve the Project details by the ID. This will give us the account ID (SVOC ID) and the userID for the quoting contact for creating a quote.
** Utilize this existing hook in {{projectDashboard/hydration/queries.tsx}}
** {noformat}export const useProjectDetails = (projectId: ProjectId) => {
  return useQuery({
    queryKey: ['project', projectId],
    queryFn: fetchProjectDetails,
    enabled: !!projectId
  });
};{noformat}
* The schema for the contacts field in the above API will also contain a contact object looking like the following:
{noformat}""contacts"": [ { ""userId"": ""12345"", ""isManagedUser"": true, ""type"" : ""PURCHASER"" } ]{noformat}
** {{PURCHASER}} will be the type we are looking for to create a quote
* The account ID and the user ID should be made available to the Add To Quote components to be able to send to ProAssist Orchestration.

We will need to use dummy data for the table since Matt’s team is still working to unlock the COM dependency (recognize Project ID attributed to quotes).  No API call needed yet - Okay to use hardcoded data for this table.

*User Story*

As an associate in ProAssist, I’m trying to build a list of materials that matches the request my pro sent me.  The Pros' lists can sometimes be dozens or hundreds of products long, and because I get interrupted frequently throughout the day…

I want to see a line item # for every product I add to my Project Materials List, 

So I can easily keep track of what work I’ve done, where I need to pick back up after an interruption, and whether or not I’ve fully captured the pro’s request. 
{panel}

{panel:bgColor=#e3fcef}
*Acceptance Criteria* 

*This would be to implement the logic AND FE provided by Nick’s team in the Product List Item component.* 

GIVEN I’m on the Materials tab within a Project in ProAssist
WHEN I add the first product to my project materials
THEN the product line item will show “1” in the item # area

GIVEN I’m on the Materials tab within a Project in ProAssist
WHEN I add additional products to my project materials
THEN the product line item will show in sequential order in the item # area (i.e. 2, 3, 4, etc…)

GIVEN I’m on the Materials tab within a Project in ProAssist
WHEN I add another group AND I add products to that new group
THEN I should see my line item numbers increase sequentially skipping past the group # (For example: Group A has line items 1-5, Group B shows line items 6-15, Group C shows line items 16-20)

*Dev Notes*

If the line item number can be done on client-side, great. If not, connect w/ Bashar to determine how to do it from server side.

POC Add Filtering to Customer Persona Component for B2B team,PPS-2730,PPS-2033,AYLIN YEPA,aylin_yepa@homedepot.com,Removed,[],,,,Medium,,,"{panel:bgColor=#deebff}
*Description*

As a result of [https://thd.atlassian.net/browse/PPS-2043|https://thd.atlassian.net/browse/PPS-2043|smart-link], [~accountid:712020:448f665b-adf7-4b32-bf4e-0ce79cbf134a] , [~accountid:637d08fe77acd224b33e1fd7] and [~accountid:712020:1d3284dc-18c9-4271-9b5f-3efdac6ca0ee]  had a meeting with some members of the B2B team (Bang and Prachi), we recognized the necessity to re-evaluate their intention to incorporate the specified component on their end. The outcome of this inquiry led to the decision to conduct a Proof of Concept (POC) using the existing filtering system at the B2B side, as detailed in the initial part of the spike.
{panel}

{panel:bgColor=#e3fcef}
*Acceptance Criteria*

* Develop a Proof of Concept (POC) by integrating the following filtering options into the customer persona component:
** Implement a dropdown menu for selecting filtering criteria.
** Integrate a search bar for entering search terms.
* Define the filtering criteria, which should include:
** Quote name
** Quote
** PO/Job name
** Number of items
** Subtotal
* Coordinate with the B2B team to present the POC and validate their interest in proceeding with the proposed changes.
* Conclude the spike story by adding a summary of the validation results
* If the POC receives approval, proceed with the merge of the POC changes.
{panel}

{panel:bgColor=#fffae6}
*Dev Notes*
The current B2B filtering system is shown in the attached screenshot. In the customer persona component, we utilize the pro-design-library table, which includes a search bar. However, we need to inquire whether it is feasible to incorporate an additional dropdown menu beside the existing search bar.

Move OVS folder to common duck,PPS-2357,PPS-2343,AYLIN YEPA,aylin_yepa@homedepot.com,Finalizada,"['PPS CY24 Sprint 2 (Q4,2H)']",,,,Medium,3,,"{panel:bgColor=#deebff}
*Background*
{panel}

In active quotes page, account detail page and order page, we’re using the same OVS queries, that’s why we ask to add it into a common folder and replace the current use, with that one.

This is needed because OVS API works with elastic search, having some complex request and large and complex responses, so have it in separate parts of the project involve risks/problems:

* A lot of code repeated
* Many not fully completely types (like in aggregations that in one part of the project includes all the type needed to do it and the other just say that should be an object) this impact the time to code and also the behaviour, this because we don't have ""linter errors"", instead, we have test it on execution time.
* Incompletely bug fixes, if someone change something from the queries, just fix in their side of the project and not at all places, so when comes a request to change something from OVS query, we need to go to each part of the project where it's used.
* Lost work, imagine that we make the request to retrieve quotes by status at active quotes page and then we need the same approach into account detail page (supposing that is a separate team like orders / lists), they will not know that we already have a request for it, and they will lost time to create it and maybe the way that they fine take more time (this is cause in elastic search you have many options to get the same request)

To solve all this, this folder should include only “always truth” in the app to can use it in separate parts without problems… for example:

The query to retrieve customers using “Start with” strategy, should be used always to find customers which name start with a term, if we want that now the strategy be “includes”, we have to added here like a new query, not modifying “start with”.

*Description*

B2B is one confirmed user of this new component we are making. They don’t have an explicit filter drawer. It’s a separate search bar, but it is essentially filtering. B2B calls another GraphQL endpoint to search for quotes based on different parameters.

B2B harmony component for search for reference: [https://github.com/one-thd/ocm_pd_component_quote-dashboard/tree/master/src/components/search-and-sort|https://github.com/one-thd/ocm_pd_component_quote-dashboard/tree/master/src/components/search-and-sort|smart-link]

*Acceptance Criteria*

* Sync with B2B team on what ‘filtering’ they use and would need in their listing page for them to use this component.
** Review search approach and determine if we can leverage that as well. Can we use the same API they are using for search but convert it to a more traditional filter drawer?
** Review their filtering options and determine how we might implement those for the Customer Persona component.
* Create follow up tasks to implement whatever is decided here: [https://thd.atlassian.net/browse/PPS-2443|https://thd.atlassian.net/browse/PPS-2443|smart-link] .

We need to be sure not to take a path that requires a hard-coding of this experience.  We should ideally make this flexible enough to allow for different filtering options depending on the persona (Pro Quote Table for an associate persona may have extra filters than the Pro Quote Table for a Pro persona).

*User Story*

As a pro associate,
I want to be able to see all quotes created for a pro company AND narrow that data down to just quotes with a certain status (i.e. “Cancelled”) regardless of what store it was built in
So I can more quickly find the quote I need to follow-up on

+Default page state+

GIVEN I’m logged into PASE AND I’m on the “Quotes” tab on the Account Detail Page
WHEN I land on that page, I should see a table with all the COM quotes I’ve created 
THEN I should see a filter button to the top right

GIVEN I land on the “Quotes” tab on the Account Detail Page
WHEN the page loads
THEN a query is sent to OVS to gather all statuses for the quotes in the dataset. 
          AND this will be available for the filter to point to in order to display the correct options. (to be done in [https://thd.atlassian.net/browse/PPS-1689|https://thd.atlassian.net/browse/PPS-1689|smart-link] )

           AND the Status dropdown should remain expanded until I click outside of the dropdown
           AND when I have more than one Status selected in this field, I should see my results using “OR” logic *(i.e. Closed OR Expired)* 

+Clicked on “Apply”+

GIVEN I have entered one or more filter options
WHEN I press the “Apply” button
THEN I should see the drawer disappear
           AND I should see my table reload with only active quotes that were created for this account SVOCID
           AND if I have one or more statuses selected in my filters, then I should see any quotes created for this SVOCID that have any of the statuses I’ve selected (i.e. Closed OR Expired OR Open)

+Clicked on “Reset”+ 

GIVEN I have my filter drawer open
WHEN I select “Reset”

*User Story*

As a pro associate

I want to see a holistic view of all the active quotes I’ve created in order of most recently modified - regardless of what store they were created in or which pro they were for

So I can easily find the one I need to continue working on and launch into that quote.  With this improvement, I will also avoid costly re-work by avoiding the need to re-create quotes because of how difficult they can be to find today. _(sometimes harder to find than it is to just re-create)_

GIVEN I am logged into the pro portal 

WHEN click on the “Quotes” page from the global nav

The back end system sets groups up as the parent to items. However, the product team does not want to make an assumption that adding an intent should auto-populate into a group. In order for the system to allow for the outlined User Story, the solution must take into account the back end api. We will resolve the back end api conflict by hiding the empty null group on the front end. Because the user cannot see (and therefore cannot move or rename it), the empty group will remain unaffected by the list manipulations. To the user, they only see items appearing above the group; while in the system, the items are attached to the empty group

We are updating the List Detail Page so that it presents a Search view of the Catalog and the List view side by side. There are 3 ways to search: 

* Search Bar ([https://thd.atlassian.net/browse/PPS-815|https://thd.atlassian.net/browse/PPS-815|smart-link] ) 
* Selecting a different intent ([https://thd.atlassian.net/browse/PPS-811|https://thd.atlassian.net/browse/PPS-811|smart-link])
* Add a New Intent from List ([PPS-814])

This story covers: Allow an intent to be created and pre populated by an item selected on a search

h3. User Story

As an OSS, 
I want to add an intent
So that I can search the intent without needing to move away from list page

h3. Acceptance Criteria

Given I am on the list detail page
When I add a new item to my list
Then the item’s search results should auto-appear on the left side of the screen AND the item keywords should appear in the search bar AND checkmarks are cleared on any other intents

*Note: When more than one item is selected via check box mark, search is canceled.

h3. Mid-fi mock

This story is focused on the functionality that Adding a New Intent brings, not changing the UI of adding a new intent.

Front End: List Detail Page moves the Search capability out of list table,PPS-812,PPS-459,AYLIN YEPA,aylin_yepa@homedepot.com,Finalizada,"['PPS CY23 Sprint 12 (Q3,2H)']",,,,Medium,2,,"h3. Background

List Detail page has a space for search so that it presents a side by side view of search and list. This view gives the user more flexibility with search capabilities than presenting search in line with the purchase intent table (existing behavior). This story captures moving the Search capability from the table item to a stand alone component on the left side.

h3. User Story

As an OSS, 
I want to see search on the left side and not within the table
So that I can search the intent results separate from the table

h3. Acceptance Criteria

* Left screen has search capability
* Right screen’s Search capability is removed

Given I am a user viewing the List Detail Page
When I input a purchase intent,
Then the search appears in the left screen and not within the list

h3. Mid-Fi Mock 

Ignore the formatting of the list details. please focus on the fact that the search results are on the split view and not within list table.

[RELEASE] Restore WebPage/Offer Schema on PLPs with FAQs,SEOIM-1399,,ZAJITH CORRO,zajith_corro@homedepot.com,Pending Deployment,['SEO IM Q3 2024 Sprint 5'],,,,Medium,0,,"In [https://thd.atlassian.net/browse/SEOIM-1|https://thd.atlassian.net/browse/SEOIM-1|smart-link] and [https://thd.atlassian.net/browse/SEOIM-149|https://thd.atlassian.net/browse/SEOIM-149|smart-link], WebPage Schema was removed from PLPs with FAQs, so that it would not conflict with FAQPage Schema and prevent FAQ rich results from appearing on SERPs. 

Google has since disabled FAQ rich results for all websites except for well-known health or government sites. Since we are no longer eligible for FAQ rich results, we recommend adding WebPage Schema back to PLPs with FAQs, so that search engines have timely and accurate information about the products on the page. 

*Current behavior:* 

On PLPs with FAQs (example below). There is no WebPage Schema markup.

[RELEASE] Migrate Popular Categories to emtContent Query - Frontend,SEOIM-1388,SEOIM-1337,ZAJITH CORRO,zajith_corro@homedepot.com,Done,"['SEO IM Q3 2024 Sprint 4', 'SEO IM Q3 2024 Sprint 3', 'SEO IM Q3 2024 Sprint 5']",,,,Medium,0,,"*Problem/Challenge/Issue:*
Popular categories was modified from a contentful component to being able to use generated json stored in our GCP buckets through a backend architecture that was replicated across numerous features (see: [https://thd.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/SEOIM/pages/2250234787/Common+Backend+Architecture|https://thd.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/SEOIM/pages/2250234787/Common+Backend+Architecture|smart-link]).  We have since developed the emtContent api (see: [https://thd.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/SEOIM/pages/2333217501/EMT+Content+API|https://thd.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/SEOIM/pages/2333217501/EMT+Content+API|smart-link]) which allows fetching data from GCP buckets we own through an aggregated asynchronous api call capable of SSR.  The api currently responsible for the Popular Categories component is the content-information-api: [https://github.com/one-thd/ocm_pd_totf-api_content-information-api|https://github.com/one-thd/ocm_pd_totf-api_content-information-api|smart-link].  The team responsible for this api (dynamic content: #dynamic-content on slack, contact Emily King) has already reached out and asked if this api call could live somewhere more appropriate.  We should migrate the call to emtContent and then work with the dynamic-content team to remove the call from their API once we are able to confirm it is no longer needed. Performance metrics should be gathered on the call before and after migration to make note of any performance gains or degradation from moving to emtContent.

*Outcome:*
The popular categories should be using the emtContent query, and the old calls should be removed from the content information api once we’ve confirmed its no longer being used (This will be a separate story to clean up unused queries).

*Acceptance Criteria:*

# Performance metrics performed and recorded on the api call using content-information-api (Home has not been performed yet)
# Record Metrics with updated query under a new date here:
## [https://thd.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/SEOIM/pages/2333217501/EMT+Content+API#Metrics%3A|https://thd.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/SEOIM/pages/2333217501/EMT+Content+API#Metrics%3A|smart-link]

Add ProductGroup Schema and variesBy schema markup on PIP,SEOIM-1350,SEOIM-1337,ZAJITH CORRO,zajith_corro@homedepot.com,Blocked,"['SEOIM Q3 2024 Sprint 2', 'SEO IM Q3 2024 Sprint 4', 'SEOIM Q3 2024 Sprint 1', 'SEO IM Q3 2024 Sprint 3', 'SEO IM Q3 2024 Sprint 5']",,,,Medium,3,,"Google has introduced support for ProductGroup Schema markup, which allows us to specify product variant (SSKU) relationships so that we may be eligible for enhanced product results in SERPs. Currently, we do not provide a comprehensive way for search engines to understand product variant relationships. We recommend investigating the feasibility of implementing ProductGroup Schema on PIPs.

Below is a possible approach to structuring the markup following the [nested, multi-page example|https://developers.google.com/search/docs/appearance/structured-data/product-variants#multi-page-example-1] in [Google’s documentation for ProductGroup Schema|https://developers.google.com/search/docs/appearance/structured-data/product-variants].

*Expected Outcome*

When a PIP has SSKU variations, then ProductGroup markup is generated in addition to the existing Product markup.

The ProductGroup markup contains the following properties:

* name (required)
** See question 1
* description
** Equal to product > details > description in productClientOnlyProduct API
* brand
** Does not vary among child SKUs
* productGroupID
** Equal to product > indentifiers > parentId in productClientOnlyProduct API
* variesBy
** If applicable, see point 2
* aggregateRating
** Does not vary among child SKUs
* review
** Does not vary among child SKUs
* hasVariant
** Do not add this right now. We’ll have another [spike to decide if this can be done|https://thd.atlassian.net/browse/SEOIM-1215]

 

 *1: Can we generate a name for the overall product group?*

This is the only [required property|https://developers.google.com/search/docs/appearance/structured-data/product-variants#productgroup] for Google rich results. I’m not aware of a name for the overall product group in any existing APIs, but we would need to find a name that could apply to every product in a set of variations in order to be eligible for Google SERP features using this Schema.

Individual product names (PN120’s) are generated according to formulas that use product attributes available within a category. A product group name would contain the brand and all attributes that do not change across the variant products.

Example:

If given the following variations, the product group name might be: “Home Decorators Collection Multi-Colored Geometric Rug”

Child variations:

·       [Square Multi-Colored 7 ft. x 9 ft. Geometric Area Rug|https://www.homedepot.com/p/Home-Decorators-Collection-Square-Multi-Colored-7-ft-x-9-ft-Geometric-Area-Rug-33776/325663881]

·       [Square Multi-Colored 9 ft. x 12 ft. Geometric Area Rug|https://www.homedepot.com/p/Home-Decorators-Collection-Square-Multi-Colored-9-ft-x-12-ft-Geometric-Area-Rug-33778/325663899]

·       [Square Multi-Colored 3 ft. x 4 ft. Geometric Area Rug|https://www.homedepot.com/p/Home-Decorators-Collection-Square-Multi-Colored-3-ft-x-4-ft-Geometric-Area-Rug-33773/325663900]

·       [Square Multi-Colored 2 ft. x 7 ft. Geometric Runner Rug|https://www.homedepot.com/p/Square-Multi-Colored-2-ft-x-7-ft-Geometric-Runner-Rug-33772/325663918]

·       [Bazaar Multi-Colored 5 ft. x 7 ft. Geometric Area Rug|https://www.homedepot.com/p/Home-Decorators-Collection-Bazaar-Multi-Colored-5-ft-x-7-ft-Geometric-Area-Rug-33775/306652985]

·       [Bazaar Multi-Colored 8 ft. x 10 ft. Geometric Area Rug|https://www.homedepot.com/p/Home-Decorators-Collection-Bazaar-Multi-Colored-8-ft-x-10-ft-Geometric-Area-Rug-33777/306652984]

Note:

There are names for SSKU groups within IDM/STEP, but they are not all of customer facing quality. Example queries attached.  



 *2: Can we add the variesBy property using logic based on child Schema properties?*

This could be a post-MVP enhancement. To use the variesBy property, we must have an exact match for the value in the child SKUs’ Product Schema markup.

·       *WHEN* each child SKU’s Product Schema contains a property named “*size*”, *THEN* the ProductGroup Schema contains a property a variesBy property: *“variesBy”: “*[*https://schema.org/size”*|https://schema.org/size”]

·       *When* each child SKU’s Product Schema contains a property named “*color*”, *THEN* the ProductGroup Schema contains a property a variesBy property: *“variesBy”: “*[*https://schema.org/color”*|https://schema.org/color”]

·       *When* each child SKU’s Product Schema contains a property named “*material*”, *THEN* the ProductGroup Schema contains a property a variesBy property: *“variesBy”: “*[*https://schema.org/material”*|https://schema.org/material”]

·       *When* each child SKU’s Product Schema contains a property named “*pattern*”, *THEN* the ProductGroup Schema contains a property a variesBy property: *“variesBy”: “*[*https://schema.org/pattern”*|https://schema.org/pattern”]

Supported variant types:

·       [https://schema.org/color|https://schema.org/color|smart-link] 

·       [https://schema.org/size|https://schema.org/size|smart-link] 

·       [https://schema.org/suggestedAge|https://schema.org/suggestedAge|smart-link]

·       [https://schema.org/material|https://schema.org/material|smart-link] 

·       [https://schema.org/pattern|https://schema.org/pattern|smart-link] 

Example markup coming soon.

 

*Acceptance Criteria:*

As a bot,

I can access valid, accurate and complete ProductGroup Schema markup,

On any PIP with SSKU variations,

In the dom and source,

On mobile and desktop,

With JS on and off.

This change requires the {{emtContent}} query be added to the page, so this might raise flags with the SRE’s. Thankfully the emtContent query is quick and will probably get added to pip pages at some point for something anyways.

* The {{emtContent}} should be fetching content from {{seo/metadata/productgroup/{itemId}.json}}.

(see test files below in comments).
* For the {{variesBy}} info you'll need use the [product data already there|https://github.com/one-thd/ocm_pd_component_metadata/blob/0bc0830868fdd6b10084e3cb56c0a3797b7555b5/src/components/ProductMetadata.js#L170] to dig down to {{specificationGroup}} [which is an array|https://github.com/one-thd/ocm_pd_component_metadata/blob/0bc0830868fdd6b10084e3cb56c0a3797b7555b5/src/components/ProductMetadata.js#L253], and then loop over the array and check each node to see if {{specName}} === “Size” or one of the other listed property values above. (see pic). Make sure the value is the actual [schema.org|http://schema.org] link above, not the value from the array node. If there is more than one match, then  .
* At a minimum, the new structured Data should include the product group name. Additional, ensure to add all the values listed in the “expected outcome” above as long as it already exists in the product data.
** variesBy, if having more than one match, is an array of the [schema.org|http://schema.org] values. (as seen in the [google docs example code|https://developers.google.com/search/docs/appearance/structured-data/product-variants#single-page-website]).

Fix Storefront journey in Store Finder,SEOIM-1325,SEOIM-1231,ZAJITH CORRO,zajith_corro@homedepot.com,Done,"['SEOIM Q2 2024 Sprint 5', 'SEOIM Q2 2024 Sprint 6']",,,,Medium,3,,"*Problem/Challenge/Issue:*

The Storefront team has been working to introduce a new workflow for the entire [homedepot.com|http://homedepot.com] site. One of their requirements was the capability to redirect a user to the {{Search}} page with a specific zip code (e.g., [/l/search/30339|https://www.homedepot.com/l/search/30324]). This zip code could be different from the localized store. Due to a migration, from {{/l/search/xxxx}} to a the new {{/l/store-locator}} page, this workflow is no longer supported by the Store Finder experience. 

We had a meeting with [~accountid:623b5f418d8b9c0068b85b4c] where we agreed to add the ability to set the results of the {{Store Locator}} page based on a new query param {{?zipcode=}}. The {{Store Locator}} page should check if this query param is present in the URL and show the proper results for this zip code.

*Outcome:*

The new {{Store Locator}} page should be able to set the results based on the query parameter {{zipcode}} passed from the URL.

*Acceptance Criteria:*

# Bump {{@thd-olt-global/b2b-theme}} to {{v3.16.0 }}
## The next components should be hidden if cookie is enabled:
### Sponsored Banner
### Store Search Features
### Sponsored Carousel
# {{Store Locator}} can set the results based on the query param {{zipcode}}  or the query param {{storeId}}.
# These changes should be in Desktop and Mobile

Fix Client Side GQL Error - Store Finder,SEOIM-1305,SEOIM-1231,ZAJITH CORRO,zajith_corro@homedepot.com,Done,"['SEOIM Q2 2024 Sprint 4', 'SEOIM 2024 Q2 Sprint 2', 'SEOIM Q2 2024 Sprint 3']",,,,Medium,,,"*Problem/Challenge/Issue:*

The current version in ratings-and-reviews introduced a new feature for PIP pages that makes an API call to the Product API. We use one of the components to show the reviews in Store Finder. However, when the component tries to make the API call, the backend returns an error due to one of the variables we pass to the query. We released this change at the end of March, and since then, New Relic has registered almost 1.8M client-side errors in Store Finder. This Error has no impact to the final user, but our new relic dashboard has all these errors listed.

*Outcome:*

Modify the existing Reviews Store Finder component to not make any API call to the Product API

*Acceptance Criteria:*

# The component that shows reviews in Store Finder should not make any API calls to the Product API.
# We do not need to change the current workflow on PIP pages
# We need to modify or add tests if the component owners require it.

Create Garden Center Calculators Component - Frontend,SEOIM-1297,SEOIM-1232,ZAJITH CORRO,zajith_corro@homedepot.com,Done,"['SEOIM Q2 2024 Sprint 4', 'SEOIM Q2 2024 Sprint 3']",,,,Medium,3,,"*Problem/Challenge/Issue:*

The store-finder experience was relying on a hotfix version of etch widgets in order to pull content from a portion of the target page.  Once that content was retrieved it was rendered within store-finder.  The content it was pulling was the calculators for Garden Center.  That content has since been removed as the team that owns it was no longer serving that content through etch.  We need to create our own component to display details about the calculators as well as link to them.

*Outcome:*

Within store-finder, create a garden center calculators sub-component (new subfolder in shared-components).  That component should:

# Use stencil styles/components 
# Should apply a tracking param to the Links for each calculator, and this should be easy to update in the future either by variable within the component or passed in as a param.

*Acceptance Criteria:*

As a user or a bot

I would like the tracking parameters to be updated

To the list of new tracking parameters provided for “Garden Project Calculators” and “Shop Outdoor and Garden Brands” on Garden Center pages

With JS On and Off

For both server side and the bot

On Desktop and Mobile

Also, make the links more modular so that the tracking param is added dynamically so that it can be updated in one spot instead of on every link.

*Dev Notes:*

in grooming, we discussed, due to old version and outdated content, we should be migrating this data that makes the calculator link cards. A solution proposed by the devs was to just create these cards statically in the experience or in their own component. Copy the image url, text and links and just make these cards ourselves since they don’t change.

Migrate Popular Categories to emtContent Query - Frontend,SEOIM-1287,SEOIM-1337,ZAJITH CORRO,zajith_corro@homedepot.com,Done,"['SEOIM Q2 2024 Sprint 5', 'SEOIM Q3 2024 Sprint 2', 'SEOIM Q2 2024 Sprint 4', 'SEOIM Q3 2024 Sprint 1', 'SEOIM Q2 2024 Sprint 6', 'SEOIM Q2 2024 Sprint 3', 'SEO IM Q3 2024 Sprint 3']",,,,Medium,3,,"*Problem/Challenge/Issue:*
Popular categories was modified from a contentful component to being able to use generated json stored in our GCP buckets through a backend architecture that was replicated across numerous features (see: [https://thd.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/SEOIM/pages/2250234787/Common+Backend+Architecture|https://thd.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/SEOIM/pages/2250234787/Common+Backend+Architecture|smart-link]).  We have since developed the emtContent api (see: [https://thd.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/SEOIM/pages/2333217501/EMT+Content+API|https://thd.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/SEOIM/pages/2333217501/EMT+Content+API|smart-link]) which allows fetching data from GCP buckets we own through an aggregated asynchronous api call capable of SSR.  The api currently responsible for the Popular Categories component is the content-information-api: [https://github.com/one-thd/ocm_pd_totf-api_content-information-api|https://github.com/one-thd/ocm_pd_totf-api_content-information-api|smart-link].  The team responsible for this api (dynamic content: #dynamic-content on slack, contact Emily King) has already reached out and asked if this api call could live somewhere more appropriate.  We should migrate the call to emtContent and then work with the dynamic-content team to remove the call from their API once we are able to confirm it is no longer needed. Performance metrics should be gathered on the call before and after migration to make note of any performance gains or degradation from moving to emtContent.

*Outcome:*
The popular categories should be using the emtContent query, and the old calls should be removed from the content information api once we’ve confirmed its no longer being used (This will be a separate story to clean up unused queries).

*Acceptance Criteria:*

# Performance metrics performed and recorded on the api call using content-information-api (Home has not been performed yet)
# Record Metrics with updated query under a new date here:

Currently, all breadcrumbs within /l/ contain a link to the old Store Finder URL. We recommend updating the link to the new URL.  

*Current Behavior:* 

On /l/ pages such as the ones below: 

* [https://www.homedepot.com/l/HI|https://www.homedepot.com/l/HI|smart-link]  
* [https://www.homedepot.com/l/Honolulu/HI/Honolulu/96817/1701|https://www.homedepot.com/l/Honolulu/HI/Honolulu/96817/1701|smart-link]

The second level breadcrumb contains a link to /l/ with the anchor text “Store Finder” 

{{<div class=""breadcrumb__item--sdpja""><a href=""/l/"">Store Finder</a></div> }}

*Expected Behavior:* 

Once the /l/store-locator page is live, then the second level breadcrumb on all /l/ pages contains a link to /l/store-locator with the anchor text “Store Locator” 

{{<div class=""breadcrumb__item--sdpja""><a href=""/l/store-locator"">Store Locator</a></div> }}

*Acceptance Criteria:* 

As a user or bot, 

When I visit a /l/ page, 

Then the second level breadcrumb points to the new Store Locator page, 

In the DOM and Source, 

On mobile and desktop, 

With JS on and off. "

”…For those reasons we have added what is called stencil verification to harmony - basically it leverages eslint to run static analysis to make sure the following

# the harmony component is no longer using core-ui or other third party libraries for stencil components.
# the harmony component is no longer using custom classes in its source (other than a low threshold to account for edge cases).

On component release the github action workflows will run stencil verification and it will get logged in the harmony db. Currently we can run queries to get a list of components meeting stencil migration guidelines. In the future this will be represented directly in the harmony app ui. “

The team leading the migration found a workaround to address this problem. However, when we implemented this solution in our components, we encountered issues that broke the release process due to a miss match in the versions in {{package.json}} file.

*Outcome:* Update {{package.json}} file in the components with these lines:

{code:json} ""overrides"": {
    ""react"": ""16.13.1"",

Implement metadata component automation on browse and PPS pages - FE,SEOIM-1147,SEOIM-1145,ZAJITH CORRO,zajith_corro@homedepot.com,Done,"['SEOIM 2024 Q1 Sprint 6', 'SEOIM 2024 Q2 Sprint 2', 'SEOIM 2024 Q1 Sprint 7', 'SEOIM 2024 Q1 Sprint 3', 'SEOIM 2024 Q1 Sprint 2', 'SEOIM 2024 Q1 Sprint 5', 'SEOIM 2024 Q1 Sprint 1', 'SEOIM 2024 Q2 Sprint 1', 'SEOIM 2024 Q1 Sprint 4']",,,,Medium,3,,"*Title:* 

Implement metadata component automation on browse and PPS pages 

*Description:* 

As a system, I should allow for customizing metadata on priority page types (Browse, PPS and child pages). The EMT Platforms team has created sample files with customized metadata for each of the page types we would like to be able to customize. We recommend developing the capability for the metadata component to read the content from these files and display it on the specified page types.  

*Current Behavior:* 

Metadata elements are built from APIs and are not customizable on a page-by-page basis except in a few cases such as schema tags on FAQ PLPs and title tags on PLPs.  

*Expected Outcome:* 

For each of the page types and affected elements listed below, when content exists in the metadata bucket files, then it is rendered in the corresponding metadata element on the website in the DOM and source, with JS on and off, on mobile and desktop.  

When a file or elements within a file for a given page do not exist, then fall back to the existing logic. 

*Affected Elements:* 

* Title 
* Meta description 
* Schema script 
* Open Graph title 
* Open Graph description 
* Open Graph type 
* Open Graph image 

*Affected Page Types and Sample File Locations:*

*NOTE:* Remove {{-qa}} for prod files

*Acceptance Criteria:* 

On the specified page types, 

When a file exists in a metadata bucket, 

Then the metadata elements found in the file are displayed in the DOM and source, 

On mobile and desktop, 

With JS on and off, 

AND  

When a file does not exist in bucket, 

Or an element does not exist within the file, 

Then the website continues to display metadata according to the existing logic.

The components access the data like {{data[0]}} and {{data[1]}} which is bad practice and prone to bugs. This story is add logic to assist in migrating over to an object structure response. 

*Expected Outcome:* The existing pages (main and child) that use [this file|https://storage.googleapis.com/hd-www-static-hdcom-assets-qa/seo/a-i/store/4.0.9/0117-pps-content.json] to get data for multiple parts of the page, have logic added that checks if its an array or object and based on the structure, renders the data appropriately. ALSO, the query that those pages are using is migrated to the new {{emtContent}} query. (see dev notes)

*Acceptance Criteria:*

# The components for the pages uses the new {{emtContent}} query. (this will need to be mocked as it’s not in stage/prod yet)
# if/else logic is added to check for if the content is array or object and renders accordingly 

*Dev Notes:*

This cannot be merged until the emt content api is merged and in stage. The PR can still be reviewed though and marked as DO NOT MERGE

See example of [PPS bucket data here|https://storage.googleapis.com/hd-www-static-hdcom-assets-qa/seo/a-i/store/4.0.9/0117-pps-content.json]. You can see it has data for the recycling component on the page, the Store Details section, and the FAQ section. 

*Dev Implementation Notes:*

The new object structure content is ready in non-prod. Sample files with new structure are as follows:

* pps main
[store 0121|https://storage.googleapis.com/hd-www-static-hdcom-assets-qa/seo/a-i/store/4.0.9/0121-pps-content-dict.json]

[1001|https://storage.googleapis.com/hd-www-static-hdcom-assets-qa/seo/a-i/garden/1.0.0/1001-grd-content-dict.json]

SEO team will make changes in frontend to look for the current data structure ({{Array.isArray()}}) and also for the new one (object structure from new files above) to act as a “feature switch”. Once our code is ready in non-prod, Andy's team will ""migrate"" over the new data structure to the existing pps-content.json files and we'll test in non-prod.

Currently entirety of Tailwind's CSS is being included in the experience's CSS file. Tailwind is supposed to be inlined into the document file and not included in any CSS file, so we’re loading Tailwind CSS “twice” in the experience. This problem is happening in both our experiences [store-finder|https://github.com/one-thd/ocm_pd_experience_store-finder] and [paginated-product-reviews|https://github.com/one-thd/ocm_pd_experience_paginated-product-reviews]

it seems the issue is that we’re importing the tailwind config file in the wrong place.

Example in store-finder:

Example in paginated-product-reviews:

!image-20240102-164407.png|width=100%!

To continue working on the migration of the 'Projects Completed' section from the old '/services' pages to the new 'Local City Pages' and due to the two APIs to retrieved the data is out of the scope of the nucleus scope, we need to build/create our backend implementation in the [store-information-api|https://github.com/one-thd/ocm_pd_totf-api_store-information-api]. The information is housed in two APIs:

# Where all the information for the cards (*Title*, *Image* and *ServiceId* ) hosted by Contentful, which is the same for all the cities.
# Where all the information for the projects completed for a specific *Service* and *City.*



The [API|https://services.homedepot.com/services/api/contentful/all-local-pages], which is connected to Contentful, stores certain information about the cards, of which only the *title*, *image URL*, and *ServiceId* are useful. We will use this *ServiceId* in the following API. This API does not receive any parameters and is used by all pages, even if not all the services are displayed on the page.

_Example:_

{noformat}""total"": 10,
""skip"": 0,
""limit"": 100,
""items"": [
  {
    ""slug"": ""window-replacement"",
    ""serviceId"": ""e57e696e1"",
    ""title"": ""Window Replacement"",
    ""testPage"": false,
    ""relatedImage"": {
      ""sys"": {
        ""space"": {
          ""sys"": {
            ""type"": ""Link"",
            ""linkType"": ""Space"",
            ""id"": ""z031v9hsq077""
          }
        },
        ""id"": ""6k5bqQrQTm9qVnYl0hgVXa"",
        ""type"": ""Asset"",
        ""createdAt"": ""2020-02-05T22:25:11.588Z"",
        ""updatedAt"": ""2020-02-05T22:25:11.588Z"",
        ""environment"": {
          ""sys"": {
            ""id"": ""master"",
            ""type"": ""Link"",
            ""linkType"": ""Environment""
          }
        },
        ""revision"": 1,
        ""locale"": ""en-US""
      },
      ""title"": ""WINDOW INSTALL - INTERIOR DESKTOP"",
      ""file"": {
        ""url"": ""//images.ctfassets.net/z031v9hsq077/6k5bqQrQTm9qVnYl0hgVXa/1d4c446f7fbb9e368a79681c79b100ea/whats_in_it_for_you_desktop.jpg"",
        ""details"": {
          ""size"": 449465,
          ""image"": {
            ""width"": 1048,

        },
      ""fileName"": ""whats_in_it_for_you_desktop.jpg"",
      ""contentType"": ""image/jpeg""
      }
    }
  }
  ...
]{noformat}



The second [API|https://corewebapi-das-it.techshed-dev.com/apidocs/#/Local%20Job%20HD%20Resource/getCitiesData] is where all the information about *Completed Projects* resides. This API request some parameters:

!image-20240102-022027.png|width=100%!

 and returns the number of projects completed for an specific *City, State* 

{noformat}{
  ""total"": 1,
  ""count"": 1,
  ""results"": [
    {
      ""city"": ""string"",
      ""city_slug"": ""string"",
      ""state"": ""string"",
      ""zipcodes"": [
        ""string""
      ],
      ""city_page_path"": ""string"",
      ""programs"": [
        {
          ""service_identifier"": ""string"",
          ""total_job"": 0
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}{noformat}



The API calls must be sequential because the response (*ServiceId*) from the first API (*Contentful*) is required as parameters for the second API. Once both API responses are obtained, a new object/array must be created that combines the two API responses, and that will be the response sent to the frontend



Suggested query:

{noformat}query lcpProjectsCompleted($city: String!, $state: String!) {
  projectsCompleted {
    title,
    image,
    total

When adding/deleting a redirect that does not exist in the data we get 400 and 500 errors. However, the notification does not catch them and it still shows a success. This can be recreated by:

# opening two tabs 
# deleting/editing a record in the first tab 
# then switching to the other tab
# and attempting to delete/edit the same record before refreshing. 

*Outcome:*

Have the notification alerts show an Error message when item already has been deleted or added.

*Acceptance Criteria:*

# Application error handling should be handled by a single component / process.
# Error handling should consider server response codes (ie: 400, 500, etc).
# No refresh should happen.
# The error code should suggest refreshing and trying again if the request failed due to 400.
# Other error codes should be handled uniquely with a default error message for uncaught or unspecified error codes.
# Include unit tests for error handling component

*Developer Notes:*

# Find where the console.logs are in the code and make sure the error is being thrown and sent to the notification.

A few weeks ago, an issue was reported where the OOPS page (404) appeared while searching for an item (304894345). Normally, this page only appears in the case of an error, such as a JavaScript error. The correct page should be the 'No Results Found' page, but due to some recent updates in the user experience, this bug was introduced.

This bug its because we didn’t extend the component {{PopularCategories}} in {{NoResultsFound}} component.

Remove Unbranded from Popular Variations,SEOIM-1087,SEOIM-1076,ZAJITH CORRO,zajith_corro@homedepot.com,Done,"['SEOIM 2023 Q4 Sprint 3', 'SEOIM 2023 Q3 Sprint 6', 'SEOIM 2023 Q4 Sprint 1', 'SEOIM 2023 Q4 Sprint 4', 'SEOIM 2023 Q4 Sprint 2', 'SEOIM 2023 Q3 Sprint 7']",,,,Medium,2,,"*Description:*

As a customer, the term “unbranded” does not reflect common search or shopping behavior. Currently, within Popular Variations cards, we list the brand and link to a PLP for that brand. When the brand is set to “Unbranded”, this displays low-value content to customers and could result in “Unbranded” PLPs being crawled, indexed and ranked more frequently. This could shift visibility from more relevant pages if Unbranded PLPs are not properly noindexed. Within most components on dot com, “Unbranded” is removed. Similarly, we recommend removing the brand link within Popular Variations when the brand is set to “Unbranded”.

*Current Behavior:*

Popular Variations cards display the brand name and link to a brand PLP, regardless of the brand value.

!image-20231010-184419.png|width=369,height=138!

Example 1: [https://www.homedepot.com/p/Unbranded-Modern-Rustic-60in-W-x-25in-H-Frameless-Rectangular-Wall-Mirror-with-Chrome-Square-Clips-FFS-25-60-CH-SQUARE/324267387|https://www.homedepot.com/p/Unbranded-Modern-Rustic-60in-W-x-25in-H-Frameless-Rectangular-Wall-Mirror-with-Chrome-Square-Clips-FFS-25-60-CH-SQUARE/324267387]

Example 2: [https://www.homedepot.com/p/Recife-Island-Retreat-Terracotta-Natural-6-ft-x-9-ft-Area-Rug-12221122063092T/100683973|https://www.homedepot.com/p/Recife-Island-Retreat-Terracotta-Natural-6-ft-x-9-ft-Area-Rug-12221122063092T/100683973] 

NOTE: There appear to be different implementations of “Unbranded”. In Ex.1, “Unbranded” is in the URL and the brand links have an href attribute. In Ex.2, “Unbranded” is not in the URL and there is no href attribute for the brand link. In both cases, we can remove the entire <a> element for the brand link.

*Expected Behavior/Acceptance Criteria:*

When the brand is “Unbranded”,

Then Popular Variations cards do not display the brand name Or link to a brand PLP,

On GM, MA, or HDH,

In the DOM or source HTML,

On mobile or desktop,

With JS on or off.

With JS on and off

*Dev Notes*

The problem seems to be from [this line|https://github.com/one-thd/ocm_pd_component_store-hero/blob/6fde6181b6477b5e1033f7fb0e716ec81f8d1257/src/components/modules/store-hero-features/features-list/FeaturesList.js#L59] in the Store Hero component. It's checking if there's data and if it has no programs. In our bug case, the data object exists with {{seoStoreRentals}} on it which _appears_ to have data because it’s existence is truthy, which evaluates to true and !programs evaluates to true too because it doesn't exist. So it thinks there's data when there's not, and renders the  default data, resulting in both. should be a quick frontend fix. You’ll want to explicitly check for the seoStoreRentals attribute having data"
Add Reviews Pagination Links on PPS Main Store Mobile View,SEOIM-1028,SEOIM-991,ZAJITH CORRO,zajith_corro@homedepot.com,Done,"['SEOIM 2023 Q3 Sprint 6', 'SEOIM 2023 Q3 Sprint 5']",,,,Medium,3,,"*Description:*

On PPS, like this page [https://www.homedepot.com/l/Oak-Ridge/TN/Oak-Ridge/37830/736|https://www.homedepot.com/l/Oak-Ridge/TN/Oak-Ridge/37830/736|smart-link] , pages 2-5 of the paginated reviews receive far fewer impressions than pages 2-5 on any other UGC paginated page type on [THD.com|http://THD.com]. One potential reason for this is that when a PPS Main Store page is viewed on mobile, the pagination links to PPS Reviews are not crawlable as they are not present on SSR, so only the first page of reviews can be crawled from the main store page.

Other similar page types with pagination widgets have links to up to 5 other pages from the initial page on SSR. We would like to align the behavior of the pagination links from PPS Main Store to PPS Reviews to that of the other UGC paginated experiences on [THD.com|http://THD.com].

 

*Current Behavior:*

When a PPS main store page is viewed on mobile, there are two buttons labeled “See All Reviews” 

!image-20230803-221754 (53f84aec-e25e-404d-bd4f-8a617ce69e80).png|width=360,height=191!

For mobile users with JS on, clicking one of these buttons appends #overlay to the URL and opens an overlay that shows a pagination widget with links to pages 1-5 of the reviews at the bottom of the page. Selecting any of the pages of reviews as a user changes which reviews are displayed within the overlay window- the user is not linked to a new dedicated URL for each page. 

There are actual links to each page in the pagination widget when the overlay is open:

!image-20230803-221806 (28718819-d2f8-4cb1-84a5-ec8e42aa187a).png|width=468,height=221!

But since those links are not server side rendered and live on the hashed version of the page, these links are not crawlable. Bots are instead only able to reach further reviews pages from the reviews/1 page ([https://www.homedepot.com/l/Oak-Ridge/TN/Oak-Ridge/37830/736/reviews/1|https://www.homedepot.com/l/Oak-Ridge/TN/Oak-Ridge/37830/736/reviews/1|smart-link] ), where the pagination widget *is* server side rendered.

On other paginated page types, like PPR and PPQ, pages 1-5 are visible and crawlable on SSR through the standard pagination widget on both desktop and mobile.

!image-20230803-221819 (af1eceac-2526-444c-bad9-dc3e7996157c).png|width=126,height=204!

PPR links from PIP

PPQ links from PIP

With only a single link to PPS reviews from the main store, there are fewer links pointing to each review page in the eyes of Google, and this might be influencing the lower traffic to these pages.

 

*Expected Behavior:*

On the PPS main store page, the pagination widget with links to pages 1-5 of reviews should work as it does on PPR and PPQ- the widget should be present on SSR on the unhashed base URL. It can still be used to dynamically show different pages of reviews to users with JS on as it does on PPR and PPQ, but the pagination links should be visible on SSR regardless so bots can crawl them and contextualize them more easily.

Ideally, we would like to replace the second “See All Reviews” button with this pagination widget

*Acceptance Criteria:*

When a PPS main store page is visited on mobile,

The pagination links to pages 1-5 of PPS reviews should be present on SSR similarly to how PIP links to PPR and PPQ,

The current tool only allows to add one entry at the time and that can take a long time if the team has hundreds of entries to add in a day. The new tool should allow to import from an excel file.

*Outcome:*

To accomplish the final result we are breaking this into 3 stories. This is the 3rd one: 

We should have an object variable with all filtered values and send all filtered values to Backend to be added.



!image (1).png|width=1644,height=1180!

*Acceptance Criteria:*

# Send filtered values to add in bulk on backend. This can happen from 2 places.
## If someone does a bulk import, and there are no existing records that match (no duplicates), then just show the confirmation message/prompt/modal indicating success or failure from the backend.
## If someone does an bulk import and it has items that need override confirmation, and goes to the OverrideTableView, then display a submit button that they have to click. Once clicked and REST request was made, handle the same success/fail situation with the confirmation message/prompt/modal.
# Show a confirmation prompt/message (could be an actual prompt or just a header message that shows briefly).
## Make sure this confirmation logic (or sub component) is dynamic enough to be reused with the single record entries and bulk entry because bulk entry could be using this from the OverrideTableView which would be a different sub-component.

*Developer Notes:*

# new redirect url entry should have the following KVP’s in the JSON data
## User input: FromURL, ToURL, Description, Department, Type [Normal/Vanity], Expiry Date.
## Generated data: History [Created By, Created On, Modified By, Modified On] - This should be saved and generated in backend.

LCP Redirect - Add LCP Sub Component in the Redirector Component,SEOIM-988,SEOIM-966,ZAJITH CORRO,zajith_corro@homedepot.com,Done,"['SEOIM 2023 Q3 Sprint 6', 'SEOIM 2023 Q3 Sprint 5']",,,,Medium,5,,"The redirector component is responsible for handling errors with a path. We need to add our own subcomponent (similar to store finder redirect component) which will handle whatever validations we need( invalid guid, invalid path length etc..) This will then forward a user to a 4xx page. 

*Acceptance Criteria:*

# Tests are added
# Make sure the LCPRedirector component is calling useDatamodel('storeSearch') inside it just like store finder (see link below)
# validated proper error behavior via pre-release in store finder exp when an invalid guid is
## find out what the backend returns as an error response when the guid is invalid. (PLP graphql responses show it returns 200 with an object that has and “errors” key with error info as the value). If invalid, redirector should redirect to 4xx page

 *Dev Notes:*

Use the [Analytics component|https://github.com/one-thd/ocm_pd_component_thd-analytics] to make the changes to add the local city page analytics availability. See [Luana’s previous changes|https://github.com/one-thd/ocm_pd_component_thd-analytics/pull/484/files] to add analytics to Garden Center pages.

Once the changes are made and deployed with analytics component version being bumped, make another PR to the store finder experience to consume the new version."
Add Breadcrumb Schema Markup to PLPs with FAQ markup - FE,SEOIM-974,SEOIM-834,ZAJITH CORRO,zajith_corro@homedepot.com,Done,"['SEOIM 2023 Q3 Sprint 1', 'SEOIM 2023 Q2 Sprint 6', 'SEOIM 2023 Q2 Sprint 7']",,,,Medium,2,,"*Description:*

In [SEOIM-765|https://thd.atlassian.net/browse/SEOIM-765] we added breadcrumb Schema to FAQ PLPs within two test classes. We’ve concluded that the change benefitted traffic and rankings while having no detrimental impact on the appearance of other Schema types within Google rich results. We recommend adding the breadcrumb Schema markup within the FAQPage markup on all PLPs with FAQs as we did on a limited set of pages in [SEOIM-765|https://thd.atlassian.net/browse/SEOIM-765].

Results from the test are described in the attached slides. The test treatment saw increases in traffic, with no detrimental impact on FAQ rich result appearance.

*Observed Behavior:*

Except for the pages we tested in [SEOIM-765|https://thd.atlassian.net/browse/SEOIM-765], all PLPs that contain FAQPage Schema markup are missing breadcrumb markup.

 

*Expected Outcome:*

All PLPs that have FAQ content and FAQPage Schema markup will contain breadcrumb schema markup.

*Steps to verify:*

# Visit a PLP that contains a FAQ content block, but is not within the [SEOIM-765|https://thd.atlassian.net/browse/SEOIM-765] test group (list attached).
# See that Breadcrumb and FAQ schema are available in the DOM and source code
# Visit [https://validator.schema.org/|https://validator.schema.org/|smart-link] 
# Enter the PLP URL and “run test”
# See that there is a single entity called FAQPage that contains a BreadcrumbList, in addition to the mainEntity array with Questions and Answers.
# See that there is no product or offer markup.
# Visit [https://search.google.com/test/rich-results|https://search.google.com/test/rich-results|smart-link] 
# Enter the PLP URL and “test URL”
# See that Google detects two valid items called “Breadcrumbs” and “FAQ”

10.  Select “preview results”

11.  See that the FAQs appear in the search result preview (this step may be unreliable due to recent Google updates)

Deployment - Canonicalize case variations for store directory - FE,SEOIM-963,SEOIM-834,ZAJITH CORRO,zajith_corro@homedepot.com,Done,"['SEOIM 2023 Q2 Sprint 4', 'SEOIM 2023 Q2 Sprint 5', 'SEOIM 2023 Q2 Sprint 6']",,,,Medium,1,,"*Description:*

As a bot, I need canonical tags to provide the preferred URL when duplicate content is available at multiple URLs. Currently, the store directory page (/l/storeDirectory) is indexable at any case-variation of the /storeDirectory path (i.e. /l/sToReDiReCtOrY). This may send confusing signals to search engines about which URL should be ranked, as shown by Google’s recent decision to rank /l/storedirectory instead of /l/storeDirectory despite millions of internal links pointing to /l/storeDirectory.

We recommend updating the canonical URL for all case variations to /l/storeDirectory so that the variations do not compete with each other for rankings.

Canonicalize case variations for store directory - FE,SEOIM-938,SEOIM-834,ZAJITH CORRO,zajith_corro@homedepot.com,Done,['SEOIM 2023 Q2 Sprint 4'],,,,Medium,3,,"*Description:*

As a bot, I need canonical tags to provide the preferred URL when duplicate content is available at multiple URLs. Currently, the store directory page (/l/storeDirectory) is indexable at any case-variation of the /storeDirectory path (i.e. /l/sToReDiReCtOrY). This may send confusing signals to search engines about which URL should be ranked, as shown by Google’s recent decision to rank /l/storedirectory instead of /l/storeDirectory despite millions of internal links pointing to /l/storeDirectory.

We recommend updating the canonical URL for all case variations to /l/storeDirectory so that the variations do not compete with each other for rankings.

Deployment - PPS Review Schema listing incorrect reviews,SEOIM-924,SEOIM-833,ZAJITH CORRO,zajith_corro@homedepot.com,Done,"['SEOIM 2023 Q2 Sprint 4', 'SEOIM 2023 Q2 Sprint 3']",,,,Medium,1,,"*Description:*

As a bot, I need structured data to provide context for content that is found on the page. Currently, on PPS Review pages, the reviews within the LocalBusiness Schema markup do not match the reviews shown on the page, which sends incorrect signals to search engines about the content on the page. We recommend updating the Schema markup on PPS Review pages so that the reviews within the markup match the reviews that display on the page.

*Current Behavior:*

The Schema tags on PPS Review pages show the first 6 reviews for the given store in order from newest to oldest. This is inaccurate in a few ways:

* PPS review pages show more than 6 reviews per page
* The sort order in the Schema tags doesn’t match the sort order on the page. The sort order on the page is: Photo reviews appear first, ordered by date (newest first). Then, reviews without photos appear, ordered by date (newest first) (see [SEOIM-525|https://thd.atlassian.net/browse/SEOIM-525]).
* The review Schema doesn’t update based on pagination. For example, the following two URLs have the same reviews within their Schema tags.
** [https://www.homedepot.com/l/Sandy-Springs/GA/Sandy-Springs/30328/154/reviews/1|https://www.homedepot.com/l/Sandy-Springs/GA/Sandy-Springs/30328/154/reviews/1]

NOTE: The number of reviews on each page does not appear to be consistent. For example, I counted 25 reviews on page 1 above. I counted 29 reviews on page 5.

*Expected Behavior:*

The Schema markup contains the same reviews that are shown on the page, for all the paginated pages for each store.

When a paginated page contains no reviews, such as in the following URL, then there are no reviews within the Schema markup: [https://www.homedepot.com/l/Sandy-Springs/GA/Sandy-Springs/30328/154/reviews/999|https://www.homedepot.com/l/Sandy-Springs/GA/Sandy-Springs/30328/154/reviews/999]

Within PPS Reviews, pages ending in /reviews, /reviews/, /reviews/1, and /reviews/1/ are all duplicate URLs containing identical content. We consider /reviews/1 to be the canonical URL and this behavior was implemented on /reviews and /reviews/ in [SEOIM-668|https://thd.atlassian.net/browse/SEOIM-668]. The behavior broke in late April, so that pages ending in /reviews or /reviews/ are canonicalized to /reviews/null, which is canonicalized to /reviews/NaN. This has caused Google to discover and rank invalid URLs containing /reviews/NaN. We recommend restoring the functionality from SEOIM-688 where PPS Review pages ending in /reviews or /reviews/ are canonicalized to /reviews/1

PPS Review Schema listing incorrect reviews - FE,SEOIM-904,SEOIM-833,ZAJITH CORRO,zajith_corro@homedepot.com,Done,"['SEOIM 2023 Q2 Sprint 2', 'SEOIM 2023 Q2 Sprint 2']",,,,Medium,5,,"*Description:*

As a bot, I need structured data to provide context for content that is found on the page. Currently, on PPS Review pages, the reviews within the LocalBusiness Schema markup do not match the reviews shown on the page, which sends incorrect signals to search engines about the content on the page. We recommend updating the Schema markup on PPS Review pages so that the reviews within the markup match the reviews that display on the page.

*Current Behavior:*

The Schema tags on PPS Review pages show the first 6 reviews for the given store in order from newest to oldest. This is inaccurate in a few ways:

* PPS review pages show more than 6 reviews per page
* The sort order in the Schema tags doesn’t match the sort order on the page. The sort order on the page is: Photo reviews appear first, ordered by date (newest first). Then, reviews without photos appear, ordered by date (newest first) (see [SEOIM-525|https://thd.atlassian.net/browse/SEOIM-525]).
* The review Schema doesn’t update based on pagination. For example, the following two URLs have the same reviews within their Schema tags.
** [https://www.homedepot.com/l/Sandy-Springs/GA/Sandy-Springs/30328/154/reviews/1|https://www.homedepot.com/l/Sandy-Springs/GA/Sandy-Springs/30328/154/reviews/1] 
** [https://www.homedepot.com/l/Sandy-Springs/GA/Sandy-Springs/30328/154/reviews/5|https://www.homedepot.com/l/Sandy-Springs/GA/Sandy-Springs/30328/154/reviews/5] 

NOTE: The number of reviews on each page does not appear to be consistent. For example, I counted 25 reviews on page 1 above. I counted 29 reviews on page 5.

*Expected Behavior:*

The Schema markup contains the same reviews that are shown on the page, for all the paginated pages for each store.

When a paginated page contains no reviews, such as in the following URL, then there are no reviews within the Schema markup: [https://www.homedepot.com/l/Sandy-Springs/GA/Sandy-Springs/30328/154/reviews/999|https://www.homedepot.com/l/Sandy-Springs/GA/Sandy-Springs/30328/154/reviews/999]

Fix canonical URLs for PPS pages ending with /reviews/ or /reviews - FE,SEOIM-903,SEOIM-833,ZAJITH CORRO,zajith_corro@homedepot.com,Done,['SEOIM 2023 Q2 Sprint 2'],,,,Medium,3,,"*Description:*

Within PPS Reviews, pages ending in /reviews, /reviews/, /reviews/1, and /reviews/1/ are all duplicate URLs containing identical content. We consider /reviews/1 to be the canonical URL and this behavior was implemented on /reviews and /reviews/ in [SEOIM-668|https://thd.atlassian.net/browse/SEOIM-668]. The behavior broke in late April, so that pages ending in /reviews or /reviews/ are canonicalized to /reviews/null, which is canonicalized to /reviews/NaN. This has caused Google to discover and rank invalid URLs containing /reviews/NaN. We recommend restoring the functionality from SEOIM-688 where PPS Review pages ending in /reviews or /reviews/ are canonicalized to /reviews/1

Add MerchantReturnPolicy to PIP Product Schema - FE,SEOIM-902,SEOIM-834,ZAJITH CORRO,zajith_corro@homedepot.com,Done,['SEOIM 2023 Q2 Sprint 3'],,,,Medium,3,,"*Description:*

As Googlebot, I need return policies explicitly defined in order to show accurate return information in rich product SERP featured called [Merchant Listings|https://developers.google.com/search/docs/appearance/structured-data/product#merchant-listing-experiences]. Currently, Google appears to be guessing at our return policies from scraping our website, which often leads to misleading search results for products that differ from the default 90-day return policy. Since we do not provide our return policies at a SKU-level through other means, we recommend adding [return information|https://developers.google.com/search/docs/appearance/structured-data/product#returns] to the Product Schema on PIP.

Google Merchant Listing shows 90-day returns:

** {{""returnPolicyCategory"": ""https://schema.org/MerchantReturnNotPermitted""}}
* When the “returnable” value in the product GraphQL query contains a time period such as “90-Days” or “30-Days”, then set the returnPolicyCategory to https://schema.org/MerchantReturnFiniteReturnWindow and set merchantReturnDays according to the number of days in the ""returnable"" value as shown below:

Migrate and change /l/search/xxxx pages to /l/store-locator,SEOIM-874,SEOIM-1232,ZAJITH CORRO,zajith_corro@homedepot.com,Done,"['SEOIM 2024 Q1 Sprint 6', 'SEOIM Q2 2024 Sprint 5', 'SEOIM 2023 Q2 Sprint 4', 'SEOIM Q2 2024 Sprint 4', 'SEOIM 2024 Q2 Sprint 2', 'SEOIM 2024 Q1 Sprint 7', 'SEOIM Q2 2024 Sprint 6', 'SEOIM 2023 Q2 Sprint 2', 'SEOIM Q2 2024 Sprint 3', 'SEOIM 2023 Q2 Sprint 3', 'SEOIM 2023 Q2 Sprint 2', 'SEOIM 2024 Q2 Sprint 1']",,,,Medium,5,,"*Background* 

The store finder page, [https://www.homedepot.com/l/|https://www.homedepot.com/l/] , is the most valuable local page on homedepot.com. It has the potential to drive more than 7k organic visits per day, as it did in October ‘22.  

The page should appear in external search results for a wide variety of local queries since it offers the most flexible and intuitive interface for searching local stores. Users also search specifically for this page, using queries such as “home depot store locator”, “home depot store finder”, and “home depot locator”. 

!image-20230718-182937.png|width=2925,height=1217!

_(Google Search Console Clicks to /l/ - Last 16mo_)

*The Problem* 

Google intermittently drops the store finder page from search results since /l/ redirects to /l/search/[storeId], which contains a noindex robots meta tag, telling search engines not to show the page in search results. In the current configuration, the noindex tag must remain so that we do not index redundant store finder pages. This behavior can be validated using Google’s Rich Results Test, which frequently returns “Crawl failed... ’noindex’ detected in the ‘robots’ meta tag” (pictured below). 

In December ‘22 - January ‘23, Google organic traffic to /l/ went to zero, a drop of 434k potential visits ($1.7M estimated GD).  

*Proposed Solution*  

“I think the ideal solution here would be refactoring /l to be the Store Search page (i.e. /l/search/XXXX ). The link to /l/storedirectory is in the footer which should be on every page a bot would visit so it is still easily discoverable.” See: [https://thd.atlassian.net/browse/SEOIM-874|https://thd.atlassian.net/browse/SEOIM-874|smart-link]  

*Requirements* 

# As a user or bot, when I visit {{/l/store-locator}}, then the current Store Finder content is rendered on the page. 
# As a user or bot, when I visit {{/l/store-locator}}, the content is localized without changing the URL. (i.e. there is no store number added to the url path)
# As a bot, when I crawl {{/l/store-locator}}, then I do not detect a noindex directive in the robots meta tag. (There will be a separate story for implementing a new subcomponent within Metadata repo for this new page).
# As a bot, when I crawl {{/l/store-locator}}, then I detect a self-referential canonical link. Example: {{<link data-th=""server"" rel=""canonical"" href=""https://www.homedepot.com/l/store-locator "" id=""thd-helmet__link--canonical"">}} 
# As a user or bot, I can still access the /l/storeDirectory page and there are no changes to the content or functionality. 
# The store list that currently appears on /l/ should be deleted from that page and any additional URL patterns. The content that should render with JS off is:
## Metadata
## H1 ""Store Locator"" (same spot as Store Finder on the /l/search page now)
## search bar & map (map will load with nothing and show a gray square but that is ok for now)
## link to store directory (requirement to add that in below #10)
# {{/l/}}  will need a redirect set up for {{/l/store-locator}} so that we can have gradual indexing fixes where [thd.com|http://thd.com] static links are set up to route to only /l/. 
## EVERY generic traffic request to just {{homedepot.com/l/}} should be redirected to /l/store-locator. 
## Connect with Traffic Man team to see if they are able to handle this. We need to make sure a store details page {{/l/Georgetown/TX/Georgetown/78628/6538}} doesn’t get missed because of /l/ being redirected to store-locator. Essentially, we need to know what kind of shallow vs exact matching they have. (this part 7.b. should probably be it’s own story)
# -Add a link (needs sudo UX input to know where to put it) for /l/storeDirectory on the new store-locator page- (requirement removed - migrated to separate post-MVP story [https://thd.atlassian.net/browse/SEOIM-1290|https://thd.atlassian.net/browse/SEOIM-1290|smart-link] )
# Update all valid references to {{/l/search/...}} in store finder. [See search results here|https://github.com/search?q=repo%3Aone-thd%2Focm_pd_experience_store-finder%20%2Fl%2Fsearch&type=code] in github to make sure routes or references are updated so that after this story is done, there’s no links to /l/search that would end up as dead links

*Dev Notes:*

Redirecting is [happening here in store finder if it’s localized and is not a bot|https://github.com/one-thd/ocm_pd_experience_store-finder/blob/6cd844045a5f3fc26b653705ec56b3c3642b6085/src/pages/SearchLoader.js#L21]. This SearchLoader component should be changed to only navigate to /l/store-locator no matter what (no if/else logic. There will be another story to look into traffic man for handling the redirecting of [homedepot.com/l/|http://homedepot.com/l/]). The redirect takes it to [SearchContainer|https://github.com/one-thd/ocm_pd_experience_store-finder/blob/master/src/pages/store-search/SearchContainer.js] which is what we want to rip the guts out of and put it at {{/l/}} . 

Requirement 5 above should be it’s own story in order to “clean up” and “fix” the existing {{/l/search/store-id}} pages so that they route to the right page until they can be removed.

As a search engine, I use mobile-friendliness assessments as ranking criteria. Currently, on PPR and PPQ, the breadcrumb behavior appears to be failing Google mobile friendliness criteria and degrading the user experience by allowing excessive horizontal scrolling. We recommend adjusting the  breadcrumb design to match the PIP.  

*Current Behavior:* 

The breadcrumbs do not wrap or scroll independently of the rest of the page, causing the width of the page to increase and allowing the user to scroll horizontally across the whole page.  

This violates Google’s “content wider than screen” criteria as well as “tap targets not sized appropriately” when the last visible breadcrumb overflows the edge of the viewport.

*Current Behavior:*

When on a PLP that has an invalid Z-value the page returns a 200 status code.

Pages with invalid z-values can be identified by the canonical tag which is the same across all pages we checked.

# Page is a PLP (URL contains /b/ folder)

# Canonical is “[https://www.homedepot.comundefined|https://www.homedepot.comundefined]”

Fix horizontal scrolling on mobile PPR & PPQ - FE,SEOIM-801,SEOIM-667,ZAJITH CORRO,zajith_corro@homedepot.com,Done,['SEOIM 2023 Q1 Sprint 6'],,,,Medium,3,,"*Description:*  

As a search engine, I use mobile-friendliness assessments as ranking criteria. Currently, on PPR and PPQ, the breadcrumb behavior appears to be failing Google mobile friendliness criteria and degrading the user experience by allowing excessive horizontal scrolling. We recommend adjusting the  breadcrumb design to match the PIP.  

*Current Behavior:* 

The breadcrumbs do not wrap or scroll independently of the rest of the page, causing the width of the page to increase and allowing the user to scroll horizontally across the whole page.  

This violates Google’s “content wider than screen” criteria as well as “tap targets not sized appropriately” when the last visible breadcrumb overflows the edge of the viewport.

Canonicalize Lower Case State/Territory URLs within Store Directory - FE,SEOIM-754,SEOIM-667,ZAJITH CORRO,zajith_corro@homedepot.com,Done,['SEOIM 2023 Q1 Sprint 4'],,,,Medium,2,,"*Description:*

As a bot, I need canonical tags to provide the preferred URL when duplicate content is available at multiple URLs. Currently, the last URL path on state and territory pages within Store Directory are case-insensitive and contain self-referencing canonical tags, which causes pages with identical content to compete against each other in search results. We recommend updating the canonical URL to uppercase for all case variations of each state and territory page within Store Directory.

*Current behavior:*

State and territory pages within Store Directory contain self-referencing canonicals for all case variations of the last URL path. These URLs are directly underneath /l/ and the last path contains two letters that abbreviate the state or territory. (i.e. North Carolina = [https://www.homedepot.com/l/NC|https://www.homedepot.com/l/NC|smart-link] )

URL: /l/NC

Canonical: /l/NC

 

URL: /l/nc

Canonical: /l/nc

 

URL: /l/Nc

Canonical: /l/Nc

 

URL: /l/nC

Canonical: /l/nC

 

*Expected behavior:*

The last path of the canonical URL for state and territory pages within Store Directory should be uppercase for all possible case variations of the last URL path.

URL: /l/NC

Canonical: <link data-th=""server"" rel=""canonical"" href=""[https://www.homedepot.com/l/NC|https://www.homedepot.com/l/NC] "" id=""thd-helmet__link--canonical"">

As a bot, I should not invest resources trying to crawl linked elements on [http://homedepot.com|http://homedepot.com|smart-link] that do not point to other pages on the site. To prevent bots from attempting to crawl HTML components that do not act as a link we should not utilize HTML anchor tags (<a>) for elements that are not linking to another page or section of the current page.

*Current Behavior:*

The fulfillment options section on PIPs across all experiences displays three options as clickable buttons. These utilize anchor tags as part of the HTML.

As a bot, I should not invest resources in crawling Home Depot pages that do not have value for external search customers. Currently, the NCNI-5 parameter is not appended to urls containing “X options available”. This refinement is used for our customizable/configurable product assortment to show how many options are available for the customer to select within a refinement, like “glass style”. This may be helpful for the browse customer, but offers no value to the external search customer as customers don’t search using this terminology.

We recommend adding the NCNI-5 parameter to refined PLPs containing: “options-available”

As a search engine bot, I need canonical links to tell me the correct URL to index when the same content can be accessed at more than one URL. Currently, for PIPs where the brand is “Unbranded”, a redirect prevents the canonical URL from being accessed, which may cause search engines to index the wrong URLs.

*Current behavior:*

On PIPs where the brand is “Unbranded”, the canonical URL does not contain “Unbranded-”. When a bot attempts to navigate to the canonical URL where “Unbranded-” is removed, they are redirected back to the URL where “Unbranded-” is present.

Change this to use the relative domain instead. 
for example if the user is on [www.homedepot.com|http://www.homedepot.com] domain, the Delivery Services link should point to [http://www.homedepot.com/c/Appliance_Delivery_Installation|http://www.homedepot.com/c/Appliance_Delivery_Installation]

These links are also using the {{http}} protocol, instead of {{https}}.

Spike: Could Knapsack's recommendation for dynamic code snippets work for us?,CON-1761,CON-1457,JESUS TALAVERA,jesus_talavera@homedepot.com,Done,"['Sprint Q4.1 11/02-11/15', 'Sprint Q4.2 11/16-11/29']",,,,Medium,5,,"*Context*

Currently, when we display code snippets on the brand reference site, they are completely manual to maintain.  We have to copy and paste source code so that it displays on a code tab.  When we update a coded component demo, the related code snippet does not update unless we copy and paste it again.  No only is this a hassle to maintain, but it also increases the risk that our coded components are out of date with the code snippet.



*Story*

As an engineer on the Brand Enablement Squad, I want code snippets displayed on the brand reference site to update automatically when I update the source code of the coded demo template so that I do not have to maintain the code snippet manually myself.



*Spike*

+Knapsack made the following recommendation to enable this in the short term:+

_“The most immediate fix would be to point to a full file path vs. a package path for pulling in these demos. currently, the platform looks at the first file it finds and shows that, which is why the native code block isn’t presenting as you want. if this was a relative path vs. package path, the full source file code would show. this may require some updates to the webpack config, but it should be pretty straightforward.”_

This spike is to validate whether this approach can work for us.  



*Definition of Success*

If Knapsack’s recommended solution seems to work, we should remove the copy-and-pasted code snippet from the code tab.  In place of that, the code embed should have the code snippet automatically included (via the “Show Code Snippet” toggle in the Knapsack interface).  We will use a single demo template to test this: the [basic buttons|https://brand.homedepot.com/site/knapsack-nucleus/latest/pattern/buttons?subPageId=Code#basic-buttons] demo template.



*Note*

We may require support from Knapsack on this, if their recommended solution doesn’t seem to work for us.  If we encounter such an issue, reach out for support from them in #kapsack-home-depot and also call this out as a blocker on our DSU."

Spike: How might we approach animations in atomic components?,CON-1139,CON-1457,JESUS TALAVERA,jesus_talavera@homedepot.com,Done,"['Nucleus Sprint17 07/18-08/01', 'Sprint Q4.4 12/14-12/27']",,,,Medium,5,,"*Context*

While doing [https://thd.atlassian.net/browse/CON-878|https://thd.atlassian.net/browse/CON-878|smart-link] for the drawer, we identified that we needed to de-scope the dragging/swiping interaction from the initial release.  This particular interaction was a high level of effort to code it ourselves and/or to research libraries to leverage.  Now that we have engineering capacity, we’ll pick this discovery back up to identify how me might approach animations for the following two use cases:

* dragging/swiping the drawer open and closed (ie. [secondary dismissal|https://brand.homedepot.com/site/knapsack-nucleus/latest/pattern/drawers?subPageId=overview#secondary-dismissal] in the design docs)
* transitions while modals open and close (ie. [activation|https://brand.homedepot.com/site/knapsack-nucleus/latest/pattern/modals?subPageId=SPECIFICATIONS#activation] and [dismissal|https://brand.homedepot.com/site/knapsack-nucleus/latest/pattern/modals?subPageId=SPECIFICATIONS#dismissal] in the design docs)



discovery action item: document pros and cons of creating our own animations, using tailwind presets, or another library of animations (ie. identify the way we might implement these animations in the current state specifically for the two use above)



note: this is a spike for a temporary approach to the two use cases above +only+.  in the future, the DesignOps team will define specifications more broadly for “Motion” across a variety of use cases."
Button - Ghost variant,CON-1114,CON-1444,JESUS TALAVERA,jesus_talavera@homedepot.com,Done,"['Sprint Q4.1 11/02-11/15', 'Nucleus Sprint15 06/20-07/04', 'Nucleus Sprint14 06/06-06/20']",,,,Medium,5,['CON-1693'],"*Note from grooming*

This is likely implemented best by taking our existing button component and modifying its background in the default and inactive state.  This is because many of the ghost button requirements match what already exists in our current buttons.

----

the ghost button is required to be consumed by the {{drawer}} for the [stacked nested header|https://brand.homedepot.com/site/knapsack-nucleus/latest/pattern/drawers?subPageId=Specifications#drawer-header]

the ghost button always contains a text string

ghost button can have a:

* leading icon 
* trailing icon



*dimensions*

* width is dynamic based on the content
* height is 44px to be consistent with Stencil’s existing buttons 

the icon size should be small (ie. 16px) only

the spacing between the icon and the text string is $spacing-2 (ie. 8px)



*states*

* [default|https://brand.homedepot.com/site/knapsack-nucleus/latest/pattern/buttons?subPageId=Specifications#ghost-low-emphasis]

*Acceptance Criteria*

The *drawer container* contains four main sections: 

* Handlebar
* Header
* Body
* Footer



There are *three variations* of a drawer

* Right
* Left
* Bottom



The *handlebar* is only supported in the bottom variant 



The *header* must contain:

* a title
* a close action icon button



The *header* optionally displays:

* a title decoration
* an arrow-back action icon button
* text labels for the icon buttons
** (?) are the text labels themselves interactable?



The *header* provides an option to persist, so that its position is fixed/displayed at the top of the drawer while the user scrolls through overflowing body content of the drawer.

* A drop-shadow is applied to the header container in the case of a persistent header 
** (?) static display, or only when viewing overflow content



The *body* can contain:

* Simple text
* Other components (text, images, icons, input field, buttons, for example)



The *body* should allow for general composability.

* Implementing engineers should be able to compose robust body content, such as those illustrated in examples in the reference site



The *footer* can contain:

* Zero, one or more buttons



The *footer* provides an option to persist, so that its position is fixed/displayed at the bottom of the drawer while the user scrolls through overflowing body content of the drawer.

* A drop-shadow is applied to the footer container in the case of a persistent footer
** (?) static display, or only when viewing overflow content



User can *activate a drawer* by clicking/tapping an interactive component, such as a button or text link.



*While a drawer is active*, the page behind the drawer should lock in the current scroll position (become unscrollable), and an overlay should appear on top of that content.



User can *dismiss a drawer* by:

* Clicking/tapping the close icon in the drawer header
* Clicking/tapping outside of the drawer container (i.e. on the overlay)
* Swiping the handlebar towards the drawer anchor



*After the drawer is dismissed*, the user is returned to the original scroll position, the overlay is removed, and the user may scroll through the original page content."

As an engineer, I want to use a tabs component from the Stencil Design System, so that I can implement UI required by the business.



*Documentation* 

[https://brand.homedepot.com/site/knapsack-nucleus/latest/pattern/tabs?subPageId=overview|https://brand.homedepot.com/site/knapsack-nucleus/latest/pattern/tabs?subPageId=overview]



*Acceptance Criteria*

Tab component states:

* unselected
* selected
* hover
* focus
* inactive

All demo templates should have a minimum of 2 tabs.

The first tab is selected by default.

Only one tab can be selected at a time.

The user can select a tab by:

# tapping it
# navigating to it with a keyboard (accessibility feature)

Tabs display in a single row only.  They do not wrap to the next line.

when tabs overflow out of the viewport, the user can swipe left/right to view tabs that are partially visible/not visible in the viewport (on touch based devices)

When tabs overflow out of the viewport, the row of tabs displays left/right arrows that are right-aligned in the row 

* overflow tab should be hidden (no peek)
* when the user cannot scroll leftward, then the left arrow is inactive
* when the user cannot scroll rightward, then the right arrow is inactive
* one click of an arrow moves the tabs left/right by one

Tabs labels are title case typography only and permitted in two body styles:

* body-lg
* body-base

Supports accessibility guidelines defined on Accessibility tab of reference site"

Allow user to pass their own string for the Menu Select Helper Text Label for Multi-Select,BENAB-2119,BENAB-649,JESUS TALAVERA,jesus_talavera@homedepot.com,Done,['2024.Q3.S5'],,,,Medium,2,,"*User Story*

As a Home Depot customer who is interacting with a multiselect dropdown menu, I want the dropdown placeholder text to display the current number of menu items that are selected, so that I am not confused by {{placeholder}} default text, which currently tells me to “Select an Option” even after I have already done so.



*Acceptance Criteria*

New demo template included on the Code tab of the Dropdown Menu page to demonstrate an implementation of the multiselect functionality available in {{Dropdown}}.  The multiselect implementation in the demo includes the following behavior:

* Given {{Dropdown}} {{multiselect: true}}, when one menu item is selected, then {{placeholder: One Item Selected}} .
* Given {{Dropdown}} {{multiselect: true}}, when two menu items are selected, then {{placeholder: Two Items Selected}} .
* Given {{Dropdown}} {{multiselect: true}}, when three menu items are selected, then {{placeholder: Three Items Selected}} .

and so on..



*Resources*

Notice in the video below that, after the user makes a selection and closes the menu, {{placeholder}} default “Select an Option” persists.  This is confusing to the end-user because the default text persists even after the consumer has made a selection.

Open theme functionality to user-provided colors + token assignments,BENAB-2109,BENAB-2054,JESUS TALAVERA,jesus_talavera@homedepot.com,Done,"['2024.Q3.S5', '2024.Q3.S4']",,,,Medium,5,,"*Context*

It is newly possible for Designers/Creative to generate a custom color scale and apply it as a theme within Figma.  The process in Figma generates .json files that could be leveraged by engineers to implement the theme. (Example .json output from Figma: [^custom-theme-design-tokens.zip])



*User Stories* 

As a Designer/Creative, I want to provide the JSON that Figma can generate to my engineering partner, so that I don’t have to figure out for myself how to communicate the color and token assignment I’ve made.

As an Engineer, I want to leverage the JSON provided by my Designer/Creative partner, so that I can pass in custom colors to my codebase for use in a custom theme implementation.

As the Brand Enablement team, we want customers to be able to pass in their own colors for use in a theme, so that we do not need to add tokens into the base system every time a customer wants to add/change a theme.



*Acceptance Criteria*

Given the JSON output from Figma ([^custom-theme-design-tokens.zip]), when an engineer passes that JSON to the theme functionality, then the custom theme requirements defined in the JSON become available to implement. 



*Notes*

It will be the consumer responsibility to include the JSON in source so that it can be pulled in.

It will be our responsibility to provide a solution for the theme functionality to leverage the JSON.

* ie. a new createVariables util to create the new variables 

For us, implementation options could be to expand the current createTheme function, or alternatively to create a net new function so that when the user is creating a theme, they can also create their own new custom properties.

This will most likely be a run-time solution instead of a build-time solution.

* At run-time, the application would create custom css properties that would only be applied to whatever element the consumer desires/specifies 
** themeProvider can be passed to specific div if desired
** themeProvider can also be passed to full page if desired by wrapping the whole page with themeProvider"

As a consumer of the stencil dropdown menu, I want to be able to implement a multi-select dropdown menu experience, so that the end user can select more than one menu item at a time.



*Acceptance Criteria*

Given {{MenuItem}}, when {{Dropdown}} is multi-select, then the checkbox remains center aligned with the menu item text label (ie. when content wraps to or is included in a second line)



Given a {{Dropdown}} that is multi-select, when the user selects one {{MenuItem}}, then the menu does not close after selection.



Given {{MenuItem}}, when {{Dropdown}} is multi-select, then the {{MenuItem}} container retains current design treatment in default, hover, active, inactive, and focus states

Spike: Drop shadow in Drawer Header/Footer,BENAB-1639,BENAB-1290,JESUS TALAVERA,jesus_talavera@homedepot.com,Done,['2024.Q1.S6'],,,,Medium,3,,"We originally had a requirement for {{DrawerHeader/DrawerFooter}} where it was supposed to show a drop-shadow over the body content whenever it overflowed and went beneath it.

The header and footer are already sticky, all they’re missing is the shadow. We originally descoped the functionality because the effort might’ve been too high and the solution possibly not very efficient. 

Ever since then we have created a few internal tools that could potentially help us achieve this. So this spike will be aimed towards creating at least one proposal on how we could potentially do this while weighing the cons and pros of each one."

Demo template: Date-Calender with 2 weeks visible only,BENAB-1367,BENAB-207,JESUS TALAVERA,jesus_talavera@homedepot.com,Done,"['2024.Q1.S2', '2024.Q1.S4']",,,,Medium,4,,"Example of how to use Date Calendar to show the code of how one could limit a calendar to display only weeks.



*Problem Statement:*

Checkout team currently has a 2-week view of their calendar due to the way their application works. When a day is enabled, there is a fetch call made for each day. So in total there are 14 calls each time the calendar loads - which is bad.



*Success Criteria:*

We want to show the same functionality that the Checkout team needs in a demo. This should not require changes to the calendar component.

* So we should create a view that shows our 1 month view calendar, a grid demo with 1 month calendar but with only two weeks enabled at a time.
** Demo should be called `Enabled Date Navigation` (TBD)
** All previous or future dates should be inactive
** There should be a pagination button in the demo so that when the user clicks next or previous, only the next or previous two weeks are shown.
** Inactive (disabled) means a user cannot interact with a day
** No API calls should be made
** We shouldn’t be using the {{datePicker}} we should be using the {{dateCalendar}}
** Static starting date: ie. Jan 2024
*** Should be some lookup table with mock fulfillment data
*** When the user clicks on an enabled date we display the mock fulfillment times for that date"

Solution to mitigate browser over-riding font-weight css property in Typography,BENAB-1240,BENAB-1301,JESUS TALAVERA,jesus_talavera@homedepot.com,Done,['2024.Q2.S1'],,,,Medium,3,,"Stencil normalized font weight set in typography so that browser styling no longer overrides

Related to how browser interprets font weights 

*Scenario*

Typography is a child of another element.  Typography doesn’t get font weight becasue wieght comes from font family.  We dont specifiy weight on the typogrsphy itself becasue font family handles this.

If in a parent, the browser may attempt to appy a font weight automatically (eg. {{TableHeader}}, where bold weight css property was being applied.)  The idea is to add the ability to set a normal {{font-weight: normal}} (ie. no css property of font-weight added) explicitly so that browser doesn't override.

User could apply the font-weight css property (which is different than the prop called {{weight}} in the {{Typography}} component, and is used only to determine which version of Helvetica to render)

To consider: Should the Typography component add this css property always by default?  Requires pressure testing but this might be a way to ensure this issue does not present again."

Our Icon Search Table uses an algorithm to filter icons that uses three parameters: name, category, similar icons/possible synonyms. This algorithm currently has a limitation where it takes an icon file name (which is usually in PascalCase) and separates the words based on where the capital letter is located.

For example if an icon’s name is “ThumbsUp” it will get converted to “thumbs up”. The problem is that fully capitalized names like “PDF” will get turned to “p d f” and the documentation (both categories and synonyms) need to reflect such naming conventions.

We have such naming conventions because we used to generate the synonyms list through a synonym generator (which we’re no longer using) and we had to accommodate. 

*Expected behavior:*

This story will required taking a look at the algorithm again and try to either change the way it reads icon names or make an exception for fully capitalized names. Whichever change is done, the synonyms and categories list will have to be updated to reflect that. This is purely an engineering effort."

Edge prop for ghost variant of button,BENAB-1051,BENAB-976,JESUS TALAVERA,jesus_talavera@homedepot.com,Removed,"['23.Q2.7 (I&P thru 8/1)', '23.Q3.1 (Closing Day)']",,,,Medium,2,,"*Context*

A consumer of stencil components surfaced an additional use case for the edge prop.

The edge prop was initially implemented [in Icon Button and Rating Meter|https://thd.atlassian.net/browse/BENAB-68].

The purpose of the edge prop is to enable consumers to vertical alignment with surrounding elements.    

----

*Use case for edge prop in ghost button*

Notice in the screen capture below that the UX designer intends for the ghost button text label to be vertically aligned with the content that displays above and below it.

!image-20230731-163030.png|width=772,height=761!



Now notice, that in the coded component, this is design treatment is not currently possible out-of-the-box with the coded component.

!image-20230731-163328.png|width=874,height=803!

----

*User story*

As a consumer of the ghost button, I want to be able to remove the padding included in the button, so that I can vertically align the text label with content that is displayed above and below the button.



*Acceptance Criteria* 

Edge prop functionality (can look at the previous implementation for implementation details)

* +Note+: Ideally, this prop would only apply to the ghost variant because the ghost variant is the only variant without a visible bounding box.  However, the risk is low that a consumer would use the edge prop for something other than the ghost variant, because it would look super wrong, so this is not a firm requirement that the edge prop only apply to the ghost variant.

*Why*

There are certain scenarios where the visible component is smaller than the specified touch target.  It’s possible that our coded UI does not have a big enough touch target in those use cases, which affects Stencil’s accessibility.

*Scope*

This story is to review the specified touch target for each component, review the coded implementation, and note any instances where the two are not aligned.  

+Note+: This scope does not include resolving any mismatch that exists.  This scope only includes identifying cases where a mismatch exists.  We will review as a team after the identification phase to agree on the approach to resolve.

We conducted a [spike|https://thd.atlassian.net/browse/CON-1761]  previously, and closed it out having realized that the Knapsack solution did not allow us to use the “seamless” style option on the reference site.

*User Story*

As an engineer maintaining the brand reference site, I want code snippets to remain in sync with demo templates automatically, so that I do not have to keep them in sync manually.

One specific example of this is allowing the use of all prop types in the Carousel package so there is no need to write the {{forbid-prop-types}} suppressor in it, but have it be required elsewhere.

Any method found to accomplish this should be explained here.


Also, some research is needed to know why some components are not throwing errors or warnings during linting, for example, with the {{prop-types}} rule."

HDY needs to generate a ZPL file based on the attached label. Currently, HDY will use the Honeywell RP4F Mobile Printer. Use dynamic parameters (ticketNumber, driverName, tractorNumber, scac, dateTime, guard, inboundTrailer, inboundLoadType, dropOffLocation, location, checkDigits, outboundTrailer, outboundLoadType, pickupLocation, tmsShipmentNumber) in the ZPL label format

I need to create and manage location preferences
So that automated moves and trailer placement in the yard is efficient.



This story is to add validation at zone rules level to verify the values with location level rules.

An error needs to be thrown from the backend which will prompt the front end to display the below message in a warning dialog to the user:
”This Zone has Location Rule Preferences that may conflict with your requested Zone Rule Preferences. Please update your request or edit the existing Location Rule Preferences.”



*Technical Details*

While adding or updating zone preferences,

Find all the location rules for that zone.

For the categories with ONLY at zone level, validate that for that category, all locations should have only the values from Zone Level. If any of the location has a value which is not part of the zone level value, throw a 400 back with the exact error message, location, and the value for each category of contradicting rules.

For the categories with NOT at zone level, make sure to have no location with ONLY with the same values for that category. If there are any throw a 400 back.





*Acceptance Criteria*
Given a user edits or creates Zone Rules
When the user hits Save from the front end
Then HDY validates the zone rules
AND
When zone rules conflict with any existing location rules for locations within that zone
Then backend throws an error to the front end to not allow the zone rule add/edit from saving until there is no conflict.

For the categories with ONLY at zone level, validate that for that category, all locations should have only the values from Zone Level. If any of the location has a value which is not part of the zone level value, throw a 400 back with the exact error message, location, and the value for each category of contradicting rules.

For the categories with NOT at zone level, make sure to have no location with ONLY with the same values for that category. If there are any throw a 400 back with exact error message, location and rule details."

Excel for ZONE_RULES Sheet consists of below columns.

|YARD_NAME|ZONE_NAME|RULE_CATEGORY|RULE_TYPE|VALUES|RANK|ERROR|

In *BulkUploadExcelService*, Add a new method processZoneRuleRows(List excelRows).

Use Yard Map, Zone Map to associate the excel record to a yard and zone.

This method should convert an excel row to a Request dto object ({{ZoneRuleGroup}}) and call ZoneRuleService method as mentioned below, 

Create new method ServiceResponse<List<ZoneRule>> *addZoneRules*({{ZoneRuleGroup}}) in ZoneRuleService. (See ZoneRuleService.{{addZoneRules}}) If required add a new method to throw an error if zone rule already exists.

This is a Spring transactional method, which should save the entities using save method on repository and construct any HDYEvents from the same method and add those events to ServiceResponse. The caller of the method will publish the events only after the database transaction gets committed without any errors. If there is an error the caller should handle the exception. For more details take a look at the flow from {{HdyEventHandlerService}}.{{processDoorReleaseEventAndPublishEvents}} (No need to emit events as we do not have events for this functionality yet)

Follow regular process for error handling. If the row fails because of validation failure or the real processing failure, error column should be updated.

Same sheet can be uploaded multiple times. So if the row already exists in DB, then error column should be updated otherwise need to create the record accordingly.

Changes in hdy-asset-catalog.
In DriverCSV add a column DRIVER_BANNED_DCS. The banned dc's should be separated by semi colon (;).

Currently if any record fails during driver upload, we are failing all the records (all or nothing). We should change it to allow partial driver upload.
Save DRIVER_BANNED_DCS entered in file, separate the DC's by ; and save the record in asset_catalog.driver_banned_location table.

If duplicate records are there in CSV the then throw an error, there are duplicate records in CSV (list the duplicates). Please remove duplicates. 
If record already exists in DB and if DRIVER_BANNED_DCS is empty then error the record (driver already exists)
If record already exists in DB and if DRIVER_BANNED_DCS is not empty then add the driver to driver_banned_location

Enhance yard-connect processes to take care of this new requirement.

We also need to maintain some kind of control based on platform types. As of now, if platform type is SDC, we will publish new message. If platform type is dfc, we will publish old message. But we should be able to publish both messages based on the configuration.

Maintain some kind of mapping based on platform type, message type and message version. Based on this, we should be able to send one or more messages dynamically.

*Technical Details:*

* Update {{protected abstract PubsubMessage transform(final HdyEvent event);}} to {{protected abstract List<PubsubMessage> transform(final HdyEvent event);}}
* Update the logic in transform method of every Transformer to verify if the current outputEventType is enabled for the platform or not. If enabled then only proceed with the message transformation, otherwise continue with next outputEventType. Also update the method to return List<{{PubsubMessage}}>.
* Update method {{public abstract OutputEventType getOutputEventType();}} to return List<{{OutputEventType}}> {{getOutputEventType();}}
* Update {{process}} method to call the methods {{validateOutput(outputMessages);persist(event, outputMessages);publish(outputMessages);}} for each outputMessage after transformation. It is also possible to have no messages coming out from transform method based on transaction types. So in that case yard-connect should not publish the messages.

*Acceptance Criteria:*

* 100% coverage on unit tests.
* Based on the yml configuration, yard-connect should publish one or more outgoing messages for an incoming message.
* We need to make sure to test the behavior based on Future Version 1 configuration and the application is able to publish multiple versions of messages for the same input message.

Attached is the example file from HDW. (just for reference). HDY gets this data from HDW and all the details are stored in yard_visit_asn table before the conversion.

We need to remove our existing process to handle po file from yard-core’s end point ({{/yard-visits/template/conversion}}) and directly try to match the asns based on trailer and scac from ASN table.

"switcher-engine: When creating move away, send operation and location type",HDWYMS-2468,HDWYMS-2485,ELIZABETH VEGA,elizabeth_vega@homedepot.com,Done,"['Yttrium Sprint 66', 'Yttrium Sprint 65', 'Yttrium Sprint 64', 'Yttrium Sprint 63']",,,,Medium,2,,"As a Transportation Manager
I need to be able to apply Operation_Type for locations
So that the Automated Moves logic can look to this attribute to make appropriate moves.

+*Technical Details:*+

in {{AutomatedMoveService}}.{{createTaskForMoveAway}}, retrieve operationType and locationType from YardVisit protobuf object  and sent the 2 values in call {{yardService.getBestAvailableZone.}}

The 2 new fields operationType and locationType should be sent to {{/api/yard}}/zones/best-available"
Current Shift Execution should only show moves from current shift,HDWYMS-2460,HDWYMS-2435,ELIZABETH VEGA,elizabeth_vega@homedepot.com,Done,"['Yttrium Sprint 64', 'Yttrium Sprint 63']",,,,Medium,3,,"Current shift execution is displaying all the moves which were completed / cancelled based on the page size. And often we are seeing Completed / Cancelled moves which were way older. 

Need to display anything within the current shift.

Currently, we have upper limit of taskDueDateTime to be less than or equal to current shift end time (Should be added only if the task statuses in search are OPEN/IN_PROGRESS/HOLD),  

We also need to provide different conditions based on current shift start time and end times for COMPLETED/CANCELLED moves. we should show all the COMPLETED/CANCELLED moves by adding the conditions of {{modifiedDateTime}} >= currentShiftStartDateTime and {{modifiedDateTime}} <= currentShiftEndDateTime. This should only be done for Cancelled and Completed so we do not lose sight of moves created in the prior shift and not completed yet (OPEN/HOLD/IN_PROGRESS).

!image-20240203-012456.png|width=1879,height=941!

Also, we need to avoid fetching yard visit details for the moves which are either competed / cancelled to improve the performance of the current move execution.

*Acceptance Criteria:*

* On Current Move Execution tab of Queue Management, when searching with default search (OPEN + IN_PROGRESS + HOLD) all moves including the moves created and due from Previous shift should be displayed.
* When searching for only COMPLETED / CANCELLED moves, only the moves which were completed / cancelled should be displayed.
* When searching for all moves, all of the above conditions should be met and display all the moves based on their status. (All incomplete moves and only completed cancelled related to current shift)"

Switcher-engine: Update Move prioritization for switcher across multiple queues,HDWYMS-2437,HDWYMS-2403,ELIZABETH VEGA,elizabeth_vega@homedepot.com,Done,['Yttrium Sprint 62'],,,,High,2,,"*Current Move Prioritization Logic:*

When there are multiple moves with different priorities across different move queues, we are giving preference to a move queue with least completion rate. By doing this the moves are not prioritized form other move queue with higher priority. 

For example, 

If Inbound Queue has 5 Pending moves and 10 Completed moves, the completion rate is 2 (Completed/Pending → 10/5=2). Inbound Queue has only Low priority moves

If Outbound has 3 Pending moves and 10 Completed moves, the completion rate is 3.33 (Completed/Pending →10/3=3.33). Outbound Queue has Critical Moves

So from above situation, we are presenting the moves from Inbound queue though the moves have lower priority because we are going with Move Queue Prioritization based on least completion rate. 

*Updated Move Prioritization Logic:*

We need to remove the Move Queue prioritization based on completion rate from findNextMove Api and just have the moves sorted on existing default sort criteria of Move Priority + execution order (based on created date time FIFO)

*Technical Details:*

Update {{findNextMove}} of {{SwitcherService}} to remove the logic to order move queues based on counts ({{getPendingTaskCountsSortedByCompletionRateAscending}}) and pass {{switcherMoveQueueIds}} to find the open tasks from all move queues instead of getting the tasks for each move queue one by one. 

*Acceptance Criteria:*

* When the switcher is requesting the next move from device, Irrespective of number of pending moves in each queue, all the moves should be considered across all move queues which the switcher subscribes to and the next move should be presented based on the Move priority and the execution order.
* Update unit tests."

* If any value from BQ result set is null (like freight bill number) instead of inserting null in yard_visit_asn table, it is storing as a string null. This will cause issues during check in.

3. For future, we can avoid deployments to enable new DCs and should be able to trigger it manually.

* Update existing endpoint {{/trigger}} to accept two optional query params - {{dcNumber}} and {{hdwProjectId}} and pass these params to Service method.

* In service method, refactor the existing method by extracting the code from lines 43 to 71 (except {{dcNumber}} and {{hdwProjectId}}). If the query params are present call the new extracted method directly, else it will loop through existing logic to sync all DCs.  

*Acceptance Criteria:*

Also when a task is blocked by another task, from the blocked reason description, we need to include the queueName so that user is aware of the task and the move queue.

# Update API (GET {{/api/switcher-engine/tasks}}) {{findTasks}} in TaskingController to add a new request param {{withDetails}} (Boolean) in {{TaskingSearchParams}}
# Add a new method getMoveQueue(dcNumber, queueId) with Cache and cache expiration period of 1 hr. in MoveQueueService.

As the number of appointments are increasing, and with Manhattan 2019, we do not get appointment updates, we have all the appointments in SCHEDULED status only. So we have large number of records present in DB causing the api calls to slow down and time out.

To fix this, we need to alter the service and repo methods  to fetch only the unlinked (not attached to a trailer / yardVisit) appointments (where yardVisitId is null)

Add a new param {{Boolean unlinked}}in {{AppointmentSearchParams}} 

Update {{AppointmentRepository}}.{{findAllBySearchQuery}} to add new param, and if it not null then add the condition of {{appt.yardVisit}} {{IS NULL}}

Once this is done, UI will pass unlinked=true from Check in page to get only open appointments. (if it is false, pass null to repo)

*Acceptance Criteria:*

When a move plan is received, each move of the plan will be processed individually, if the move is processed and is persisted or if there is a business error, a message is published to Unload Planner (story HDWYMS-1446) for every move. A message must be sent to the HDY adapter (one per message sent to Unload Planner) including the {{externalMoveId}} as the message ID.

*Technical notes*

* The message publishing should be transactional with the data persitance.
* Message publishing to {{switcher-engine}} topic.
* All messages should be published so the {{switcher-engine}} topic will eventually be processed by HDY adapter ({{hdy-osc-r2r-adapter}} repo).

Suggested messages formats are a below

Unload Planner - Rejected Moves,HDWYMS-1634,HDWYMS-1111,ELIZABETH VEGA,elizabeth_vega@homedepot.com,Done,"['Yttrium Sprint 44', 'Yttrium Sprint 43']",,,,Medium,3,,"As a YMS integrated with Unload Planner
I need to send Outbound Messages to Unload Planner for rejected moves
So that Unload Planner is aware of what happened with the move they sent to HDY.

This story is to detail the reasons in which HDY will send a REJECT status outbound message to Unload Planner in the event of a rejected trailer move. Below are scenarios in which the REJECT message may be sent:

# Reject moves to Unload Planner if there is no available shifts - Send REJECT status message back to UP
# If move is unable to be created for any reason by HDY (duplicate, invalid, etc.) - Send REJECT status message back to UP.
# If a move is sent from UP as a move_plan_update and for any reason (can be very generic reason) HDY cannot create the move - Send REJECT

*Considerations*

* Rejected messages should be logged in Event Log application.
* Rejected moves should not be persisted in the task table in the switcher_engine HDY database.
* Rejected messages must include information of rejection root cause in the {{task.errorMessage}} message attribute (see [move_update|https://github.com/one-thd/dfc-up-yms-move-plan-schema] contract schema for more details)

*Technical notes*

* Add REJECTED status in the {{hdy-protocol}} submodule next to the other Task statuses.
* Business validations - ack and send reject message
* Run time errors - nack the message and keep retrying

*Acceptance criteria*

* 90%+ test code coverage
* Include an integration test case scenario
* Test all 3 scenarios above (for 3rd scenario try to shut down local database to test)"

## Possible States: There will be 3 possible states based on whether the Stack is assigned to an active Model.  States: Active, Inactive, To Be Purged
## Assign State Value based on the following Rules:
### Active = Stack is attached to at least one Model that is 'Active & Stale' or 'Active & Refreshed'
### Inactive = Stack is not attached to an active model and Stack is attached to at least one Model that is 'Inactive & Stale' or 'Inactive & Refreshed'.
#### *OR Stack is not attached to a model and was created/updated in the last 30 days*
### To Be Purged = Stack is attached to models where the status of all the models is 'To Be Purged'
#### *OR Stack is not attached to a model and was created/updated greater than 30 days ago.*

Acceptance Criteria:

# Update Clean-up script to set Model State based on the following rules.
## Possible States: There will be 5 possible states based on whether the Model is assigned to an active API and whether the model data is being refreshed on a regular cadence.  
## Assign State Value based on the following Rules:
### Active & Refreshed
#### Model is assigned to at least one ‘Active’ API
#### Model Data has been refreshed in the last 30 days
### Active & Stale
#### Model is assigned to at least one ‘Active’ API
#### Model Data hasn’t been updated in over 30 days
### Inactive & Refreshed
#### Model is not assigned to any Active APIs
#### Model Data has been refreshed in the last 30 days
### Inactive & Stale
#### Model is not assigned to any Active APIs
#### Model Data hasn’t been updated in over 30 days
### To be Purged
#### Set to 'To be Purged' when a models status has been 'Days Inactive - Stale' for greater than 30 days.
#### The 30 day value should be defined as a configurable value so we can adjust as we determine a better range.
#### Note: We may eventually auto purge but for now this will be used for validation while we get comfortable that the rules are correct.

* So the context is:
** Symphony Springboot in prod is 1.3 [https://github.com/one-thd/symphony/blob/942d2c04c173b75902b0c5294c754245aa6ea43f/pom.xml#L18|https://github.com/one-thd/symphony/blob/942d2c04c173b75902b0c5294c754245aa6ea43f/pom.xml#L18|smart-link]
** New updates to Sprinboot are 2.6.6 [https://github.com/one-thd/symphony/blob/09247acbf137f0cfaaeaada2d1274f5fc16f969f/pom.xml#L18|https://github.com/one-thd/symphony/blob/09247acbf137f0cfaaeaada2d1274f5fc16f969f/pom.xml#L18|smart-link]
** When workflows complete in Orangetree, they submit a pub sub message to Symphony for model validation. Symphony looks in the models and stacks and checks if any models are ready to execute. That means, all stacks and their strategies are complete.
** The issue: In the new SB versions. When you have multiple model validations submitted, they do not trigger in parallel. They should, all the calls in Symphony are asynchronous. Instead they are queued up. You can replicate this by preloading the inputs to multiple models in dev, and then manually triggering the models. If I recall correctly, you can see the error and where it gets stuck in the PubSubMessageExecutor class: [[https://github.com/one-thd/symphony/blob/09247acbf137f0cfaaeaada2d1274f5fc16f969f/|https://github.com/one-thd/symphony/blob/09247acbf137f0cfaaeaada2d1274f5fc16f969f/][…]epot/personalization/symphony/pubsub/PubsubMessageExecutor.java|[https://github.com/one-thd/symphony/blob/09247acbf137f0cfaaeaada2d1274f5fc16f969f/src/main/java/com/homedepot/personalization/symphony/pubsub/PubsubMessageExecutor.java#L112|https://github.com/one-thd/symphony/blob/09247acbf137f0cfaaeaada2d1274f5fc16f969f/src/main/java/com/homedepot/personalization/symphony/pubsub/PubsubMessageExecutor.java#L112]]
** You will have to SSH into Symphony and goto its container logs. Then trigger a bunch of models to run, and you should see some model validation logs from validate and submit model: [[https://github.com/one-thd/symphony/blob/942d2c04c173b75902b0c5294c754245aa6ea43f/|https://github.com/one-thd/symphony/blob/942d2c04c173b75902b0c5294c754245aa6ea43f/][…]medepot/personalization/symphony/util/ModelValidatorHelper.java|[https://github.com/one-thd/symphony/blob/942d2c04c173b75902b0c5294c754245aa6ea43f/src/main/java/com/homedepot/personalization/symphony/util/ModelValidatorHelper.java#L507|https://github.com/one-thd/symphony/blob/942d2c04c173b75902b0c5294c754245aa6ea43f/src/main/java/com/homedepot/personalization/symphony/util/ModelValidatorHelper.java#L507]]"

h1. Overview

We need to calculate and store the Average API Requests/Day based on a weeks worth of data.  These metrics will eventually be used to set the state of an API as a part of automating the API clean-up. 

Store the following data in the API Data Store used by Symphony and DRecs:

* Average Request Per Day: Use Requests Per Week as the number to calculate the average.
* Number of days the Average Requests Per Day has been Zero

h1. Acceptance Criteria

* Average Request Per Day is stored in the API Data Store used by Symphony
* Number of days @ 0 is stored in the API Data Store used by Symphony
* Metrics are updated daily

h1. Useful Links

h1. Notes

* Have a cron scheduled method in Symphony that will run these queries.
* In Symphony, there's a {{ScheduledTasks.java}} class that can be used. We have the {{BigQueryManager.java}} class available for running a BQ statement using the Java library"

It works in much the same way as the SSL, using encryption to protect the transfer of data and information. The two terms are often used interchangeably in the industry although SSL is still widely used.

 

The solution to this is to update the startup Args to include TLSv1.2

Prior to making a fix , reproduce the issue in NP by kicking off 2 or more purges at the same time.

1.Sequence Generator calls POMPurge /purgePOAndASNByPOSeq/{poSequence} end point when a sequence rollover happens to purge the records.

2.The end point could take several minutes to purge the records across all the tables. However if the same endpoint is called accidentally (by a network retry) the purge should not get triggered when one is already running. A means of lock has to be established .

*Purpose:* A small bug was found in our system. We are considering SKUs with a cost of 0.01 as 0 so we eventually pull the data from the master data endpoint to setup unit cost
{panel}

{panel:bgColor=#e3fcef}
*Acceptance Criteria:*

* Special Cost was passed on an order request with cost as 0.01. The same cost has to be populated on the EXTNL_ORD_LN and transmitted downstream. Currently, it is rounding it as 0 and setting the cost value from the pricing service.
* If the Special Cost is passed on the request >= 0.01, then the cost on the incoming request must be honored.

*User Story: What and Why*

*Why:* TMS is expecting a field in an RDC PO that will indicate which facility is being used if the vendor cannot use the configured facility in exception scenarios like a fire or a flood. This facility ID is currently configured in BYOPO in BYOPO.ORIG_TMS_FALIAS_ID and is applicable only for Sync generate POs. As RDC POs are migrated to POM , TMS expects that to be passed in the payload published in PubSub as well as in the REST end point. Since this field is derived by optimization , POM PO expects the field to be passed in the PO Request. POM PO will save this field and pass it to all destinations with the exception of EDI.

        }]
# Store the COVRPO in database in. a separate table (PurchaseOrderData)
# While flattening out srcSystemIds to message attributes, any attribute having COVRPO has to be excluded (POMGCPPublisher)
# -When a PO is read in PurchaseOrderData , srcSystemIds is expected to have the COVRPO if the order has an associated covrPO-
# -When a PO is read in CommonReadService , srcSystemIds is expected to have the COVRPO if the order has an associated covrPO-

{panel:bgColor=#e3fcef}
Acceptance Criteria
{panel}

When TMS Shipment is received with COVR POs, COVR PO has to be stored in the COVR_PO Table

COVR PO also has to be stored in the SRCSystemIDs for each associated POM PO

In Pub/Sub Topic the COVR PO should not be flattened out along with other SRCSytemIDs in the message attribute

Once a POM PO is associated with a COVRPO , any subsequent updates to the PO should always have the COVRPO detail in srcSystemIDs node.

{panel:bgColor=#deebff}
Purpose
{panel}

Adding srcSystemIDs to the header so that downstream can filter the subscriptions.



{panel:bgColor=#e3fcef}
Acceptance Criteria
{panel}

# Add srcSystemIDs to the header in POM GCP Publisher application



{panel:bgColor=#eae6ff}
Dev Notes
{panel}

The srcSystemIDs is an array of key-value pairs so it has to be flattened out as follows
Header name should be srcSystemID-""key name""
Header value should be ""key value""
So if the JSON contains the following JSON
    ""srcSystemIds"": \[{
      ""keyType"": ""HOT_UPLOAD"",
      ""value"": ""123456""
    },{
      ""keyType"": ""DemandID"",
      ""value"": ""888""
    }]
The headers will be
srcSystemId-HOT_UPLOAD : 123456
srcSystemId-DemandID : 888

Please test from end to end by creating an order from POMExternalOrderIntegration and that will route the order to POMExternalOrderGateway - > POM GCP Publisher. "

Acceptance Criteria

Given I am on project materials list and I have a group selected with its items,
When the Associate selects ""remove"" 
Then a modal will appear and ""remove all items"" will be default selected

Given the modal appears, 
When I click X or Cancel,
Then the modal will disappear and no changes are saved

Given the modal appears and I have selected Remove all items and the group,
When I select Remove, 
Then the items and the group are removed

Given the modal appears and I have selected Remove all items with the radio button,
When I select Remove, 
Then the items are removed but the empty group remains in the list

*Testing Note:* This only works with the group selected. If the group is not selected, then the group removal modal does not appear.

All functionality for the below endpoints will be implemented for Draft Quotes.  Per [~accountid:62ab43d06085950068afa658], the endpoints below will be the same, but will have a different client-facing endpoint that uses {{project-list}} instead of {{material-list}}.

This will entail reusing the following endpoints:

Item Resolution Endpoints: 

* Get suggested resolutions
* Resolve item
* Unresolve item 
{panel}

{panel:bgColor=#eae6ff}
*Implementation Notes*

* One PR for each copied endpoint (so 3 for this story)
* Reuse as much as possible, so the only new methods should be in the resource files for the endpoints. If you think you need to create a new method to complete the method, reach out to [~accountid:62ab43d06085950068afa658] and  discuss it together
* For each endpoint, we need to have:
** an API spec in the list-api.yml file
** Tests in the postman collection
** Integration tests

*User Story* 

As a pro associate 

I want to see the Active Quote Number (“Order #”) linked to my Draft Quote Number (“Draft Quote #”) in various places within the experience

So that I can follow the progress of this pro’s project plan and see additional context (notes, intents, history)
{panel}

{panel:bgColor=#e3fcef}
*Acceptance Criteria*

This ticket will be considered done when there is a way on the backend to save the Active Quote ID # that comes back from Order Up after a pro associate successfully submits a draft quote to Order Up.
{panel}

{panel:bgColor=#fffae6}
*Context from FE A/C*

+Condition: Draft Quote # linked to Order # on Quotes Listing Page table+

GIVEN I am logged into the new portal AND I’m on the Quotes page AND I’m on the “Active Quotes” tab

WHEN I see a quote in the table Active Quotes Table that is now an Active Quote AND it began as a draft quote

THEN 

* I will see the Draft Quote # in the Draft Quote # column AND that Draft Quote # will be a hyperlink AND that hyperlink will take me to the Draft Quote Detail Page for that specific draft quote
* AND I will see the Active Quote # from OrderUp in the “Order #” column

+Condition: Active “Order #” displays on Draft Quote Detail Page once converted to OrderUp+

GIVEN I am logged into the new portal AND I’m on a draft quote detail page AND I successfully convert that draft quote to an active quote by pressing “Send to OrderUp”

WHEN I revisit that draft quote detail page

THEN I will see the “Order #” from OrderUp displayed on the draft quote detail page AND the “Order #” is hyperlinked AND the hyperlink takes me to that “Order #” in OrderUp
{panel}

{panel:bgColor=#fffae6}
*Dev Note*

We will still use the Quote Discovery (OVS) to hydrate the Active Quote Listing Page, but we will do a lookup in our own database to determine if the active quote originated in our service as a draft quote.  If so, we will do a secondary hydration on the Active Quotes table to show the Draft Quote #.

*Steps to Reproduce:*

# Log in to the user management system with admin credentials.
# Navigate to the user management section for store 0130.
# Select the associate's account (previously inactive, now set to active in the backend).
# Observe that the 'Update' button remains disabled, despite the user's active status.

# Navigate to the initial consultation flow on the *dashboard and Calendar page.*
# Select the option to create a new initial consultation.
# Fill in the necessary details for the new project.
# Click on the ""Create Project"" button.

# Create a new endpoint to return the history of projects, appointments, notes, reminders, and transfer.
# The change history should be easily accessible and viewable within the pipeline management system.

h1. Technical Notes

We’re currently saving logs in two tables: {{activity}} and {{project_transfer_history}}

In {{activity}}:

* Activity id: auto increment bigint
* Description: mixed string with summary, then an underscore and a comma separated list of props. i.e.
{{New Note Created! _Performance Test, By SMP004, In 3000, On }}
{{Appointment Updated _2023-06-02 02:00 AMTEST TEST, 2023-06-02 02:00 AM, By SMP001, In 9100, On}}
{{New Reminder Created! _PT, By SMP001, In 9100, On}}
* Project id
* Created by: LDAP of the associate
* Activity date: UTC timestamp

A record in {{activity}} is created when one of the following actions happen:

* Reminder is created, updated
* Appointment is created, updated, canceled
* Project note is created, updated

In {{project_transfer_history}}:

* id: UUID
* Project id
* Transferred by: LDAP of who started the transfer
* Transferred to: LDAP of the associate or “DCx”
* Transfer date: UTC timestamp
* Source store: Original store of the project
* Destination store: New store of the project
* Notes
* Reason: “Customer choice” or “Store choice”
* Previous assignee

A record in {{project_transfer_history}} is created when one of the following actions happen:

* Project being claimed
* Transfer project to associate/store
* Transfer project to DCx

h2. Conclusions

It looks like we’re not preserving all the required information to comply with the acceptance criteria, specifically, we’re missing some project events:

* Project stage update
* Project details update
* Documents upload
* Archive/Unarchive
* On hold/Clear hold"

As a pipeline management user, I encountered a bug while creating a project from the dashboard using the ""Create New Project"" button. The system currently forces me to create an appointment, which is not the expected behavior. The desired flow is to only create the project without requesting appointment details, following the same process as the ""Start New Project"" button on the project list page.

*Steps to Reproduce:*

# Navigate to the dashboard.
# Locate the ""Create New Project"" button.
# Click on the ""Create New Project"" button.
# Observe that the system prompts for appointment details instead of directly creating the project.

Expected Behavior: When I click on the ""Create New Project"" button from the dashboard, I should be able to create a new project without being asked to provide appointment details. The flow should match the behavior of the ""Start New Project"" button on the project list page, where project creation occurs without the need for appointment information.

*Acceptance Criteria:*

# Clicking on the ""Create New Project"" button from the dashboard should trigger the project creation process directly, without requesting appointment details.
# The project should be successfully created.
# The flow for project creation from the dashboard should align with the behavior of the ""Start New Project"" button on the project list page.
# The user should not encounter any unexpected prompts or unnecessary steps during the project creation process.

*Note:* This bug does not affect the project creation flow from the project list page, where the ""Start New Project"" button is functioning correctly. The issue is specific to the ""Create New Project"" button on the dashboard. Please see the below video for reference.

*Description*

As a PA user viewing a Project, I need the ability to quickly repurpose a projects material list for another existing project or a new project. I can select specific SKUs, Groups, or All materials (1) that I want to copy to another project/new project. Note: prior to selecting any materials, the Copy Materials link is _inactive_ (2).

Once I’ve selected the materials I want to copy (3), the “Copy Materials” link becomes active (3). 

By selecting “Copy Materials”, a drawer slides out with the option to either “Copy to New Project (5) or I can select an existing project that I want to copy the materials to (6). 

This story is to move the Copy to New Project option from the current modal to the drawer (5)

Note: Numbers in the description align to the numbers/steps in the screenshot.

Setting the status to Active or Archived makes them available in the UI to filter to (pending filtering capabilities). Delete is a soft delete and the record will still exist in Project Domain but not available in UI via ProAssist or B2B.

h2. Description of Work

h4. General description

*Finding #1:*  
When a user selects two departments—one with a specific class and the other with “All”—and aggregates by Department, the table only displays data for the department that has a selected class. 

* *Example:*  
If a user selects:
** Department: 21-LUMBER  Class: 021-001-PLYWOOD  Subclass: All  
** Department: 22-BUILDING MATERIALS  Class: All  Subclass: All  

      The table currently shows only the data for 21-LUMBER.

* *Solution:*  
The table should display data from both selected departments, regardless of whether there are selected classes or subclasses for one of them.

*Finding #2:*  
When a user selects two departments—one with a specific class / subclass and the other with “All” on both levels—and aggregates by Subclass, the table currently displays the selected subclass and all the subclasses from the other department.

* *Solution:*  
Implement autocomplete functionality only when drilling down from the upper DCS level shared across all DCS keys. For aggregation, this means:
** *D (Department):* Display data from both selected departments.
** *C (Class):* Show the selected class and autocomplete from the other department.
** *S (Subclass):* Display only the selected subclass.

PR Validation GitHub Workflow: Hardcoded Env Variables,O1-8601,,NOE CAMPOS,noe_campos@homedepot.com,Groomed,[],,,,Low,3,,"h3. User Story

*As a developer,*  
*I want a GitHub Action Workflow* to validate if a PR has hardcoded Environment Variables,  
*So that we can avoid merging to dev the Pull Requests.*

h3. Description of Work

h4. General Description

We need to create a GitHub Actions workflow (on both API and DAG repositories) using Bash that performs the following tasks:

# *Trigger Conditions:*
#* The workflow should execute only when a Pull Request (PR) is opened or when commits are pushed to an existing PR.
# *Branch Checkout:*
#* The workflow must checkout the current branch and ensure that the {{dev}} branch is also fetched.
# *Bash Script Execution:*
#* A Bash script will be executed to perform the following operations:
#** Retrieve a list of modified files by comparing the current branch with the {{dev}} branch.
#** Discard any files present in the ignore list as well as any non-{{.sql}} and non-{{.py}} files.
#** Search for hardcoded strings related to:
#*** BigQuery environment variables: ({{np-iot-thd}}*,* {{rc-iot-thd}}, etc.)
#*** Temporal datasets: ({{TEMP_ONEDAY}}*,* {{TEMP_ONEWEEK}}*,* {{TEMP_ONEMONTH}})
#*** THD emails: ({{*@homedepot.com}})
#** For each hardcoded string found, log the details including:
#*** File name
#*** Line number
#*** The hardcoded string
#** Post the log as a comment on the PR.
# *Workflow Fail Condition:*
#* If at least one hardcoded string is found, the workflow should fail and block the PR from merging. Ensure to add the appropriate ruleset to the repository to enforce this.

h4. Additional Requirements

* Utilize Bash scripting along with commands such as {{find}}, {{git diff}}, and {{awk}} to implement the solution.
* Use regular expressions (regex) to identify hardcoded strings while avoiding false positives from comments. The regex should:
** Include backticks (`) for BigQuery strings.
** Include single quotes (') or double quotes ("") for email addresses.
* Maintain a list of files to ignore during validation (e.g., {{utils.py}}, {{test_*.py}}), as these files are known to contain such strings as part of their functionality.
** This list should be custom to each repository.

h4. Additional Considerations

* Ensure the script is scalable and can be easily updated to accommodate any new patterns or files in the future.
* Include comprehensive logging for debugging purposes.
* When naming the workflow, jobs, and steps, consider that this workflow will be used for any validation jobs we find useful in the future.
* The story is considering both repositories due to the Workflow logic being the same, only changing the files on the list of files to ignore.

Describe the bug.

h4. Actual Result:

On KPI Comparison dashboards, there's no difference between when a user doesn’t make any selection (letting the system autocomplete) and when they manually choose ""All"" in the filter. In both cases, the system sends a request with ""All"" included in the data. This can sometimes lead to unexpected issues.

For instance, if a user selects multiple departments, classes, and subclasses, including ""All"" subclasses for one of them, the filter might not work properly. This happens because the system sends a request with ""All"" in the subclass filter, which can prevent the user from aggregating by subclass in the UI

Both in RC and PR, when selecting one Department (or more) and aggregating by Classes, the YoY table disappear.

The obtained response on the Browser Network Inspector, shows this error:

{noformat}{
  ""error"": ""IndexError('index 0 is out of bounds for axis 0 with size 0')"",
  ""stack trace"": [
    ""File : /app/axen_svc/dao/product_dao.py , Line : 5627, Func.Name : get_merch_kpi_comparison_table_data, Message : metric_name = df_tmp.filter(like=\""_YOY\"").columns[0][:-4]"",

  ]
} {noformat}

That means that the {{get_merch_kpi_comparison_table_data}} is not getting data from any of the metrics YoY functions, due to another error on the individual metrics YoY functions.

{panel}

 A standard threshold of -$25K is not serving the needs of various merchants at a department level because each department implements various strategies for clearing inventory.  Having a standard threshold for all DCS is forcing certain users to constantly snooze alerts or exclude it from monitoring  As we move towards customization, we need to allow our users the ability to monitor their departments based on their strategic priorities 

With the last set of changes where users saw pressure last year this custom pilot has a potential impact of up to $24M

h2. Description of Work

h4. General description

The current APIs for Intraday Charts will handle only for single select of different filters. For multi select logic, the APIs need to handle the dynamic aggregation of metrics for multiple values in a single filter. It should follow the same functionality of what is available in the Merch Pinboards.

*Note:*

# Look out for any missing LY metric in the final table which is being used in the VLY metric
calculation and add that LY metric in the final table. We will need the LY metrics at the
API layer to calculate the VLY metrics.
# Look out for any derived metric for ex . Conversion metric and verify if the metrics that
it is derived from are also available in the final table, if not we have to add that.
# Ensure existing time periods work well
# Ensure existing Experience type and channel dropdown filter without multiselect works well with the new changes
# Remove formatting in all final tables as they need to be aggregated in their respective API SQLs where the formatting must be handled.

----

h2. Description of Work

h4. General description

Hey team, during data validation, the TBAs found this issue with Avg Rating in Charts (this is the same issue that we have in table & cards) - it looks like we are taking the average of avg:

As highlighted on stand up, we have found a discrepancy for avg rating while validating the APIs for KPI comparison. Here is a quick summary for one of the test cases:

!image.jpg|width=800,height=399,alt=""image.jpg""!

We have pulled data for a DCS, IDM and MFG brand multi-selection and below is the output returned by the API: 

 

The highlighted number 2.7 did not match our expected output so we proceeded to validate it against Nuro frontend for confirmation. Below is a snip of the same:

!image (1).jpg|width=50%,alt=""image (1).jpg""!

There are three nuro cube pivots here- 1st returning the output of one set of DCS,IDM, MFG; 2nd returning the output of another set of DCS,IDM, MFG and third where both these sets are selected together. The expected output is 3.83 whereas you can see if we take an avg of individual avg rating values- it matches axens output of 2.7.

The scope of this work is to modify the API to allow users to use the Aggregate By Button at a THD level for the following filter options:

* IDM
* Brand
* Mvendor
* Pvendor

When the user is at a THD level, they should be able to select down to a sub-class aggregation for the table, but once they select a d/c/s, they should be restricted and only allowed to the level they have filtered for.

This story should also allow the UI to only show the aggregation options that are possible given the data/selected filters.

Implement the required changes to mitigate errors, optimize the execution of the NLG DAG, as well as enhance readability and maintainability for the files described in attached document ([https://thd.atlassian.net/browse/O1-6499|https://thd.atlassian.net/browse/O1-6499|smart-link]).

The scope of this story focuses on the files:

* fulfillment_insights_generator.py

While refactoring the code, it's important for the assignee to actively seek optimizations and address any errors or warnings that might not have been documented in the original specifications. Any new optimizations or solutions should be documented on Jira and/or in the Github pull request. This practice ensures knowledge sharing across the different epic stories.

Once a user saves a selection (opt in & DCS Selection) for Attachment Analysis reporting, we need to record it in our account report table for use by bizdev, including the account segment and fiscal period the user chose. The scope of this story includes the following changes:

* Adding extra column to LUMIERE_REPORT Table for Attachment Analysis. The column name could be *ATTACHMENT_ANALYSIS_FLG.* This column should record new selections of this analysis and modified selections (opting out or opting in later, after a user’s initial report selections are made)
* Adding extra column to LUMIERE_REPORT Table for Attachment Analysis DCS. The column name could be *ATTACHMENT_ANALYSIS_DCS.* This column should record new DCS selections of this analysis and modified selections - This is required if a user has opted in

* Modifying Get Report, Create and Update Report APIs to accommodate this new report type. The parameter name can be *include_AttachmentAnalysis_flag*

h2. Description of Work

h4. General description

Create a final validation step in the NLG DAG that validates if all time periods are present for a given pinboard’s insights. As of the writing of this story, there are 10 time periods to check per pinboard:

* YST
* LM
* LQ
* LW
* WTD
* MTD
* QTD
* YTD
* R12_MONTHS
* R13

This step should look to see if these time periods are present in the NLG stage tables after the run, and should fail if any are not present. A failed DAG should list what time periods failed to validate and for which pinboard, this can be handled by throwing an error in the DAG and logging it.

h4. General description

We’ve received a number of DagBag import timeout errors in our DAGs, specifically within our ANOMALY_DETECTION_DAG: [https://console.cloud.google.com/errors/detail/CLr0p46-6e65Zg;time=P30D?project=pr-iot-thd&utm_source=error-reporting-notification&utm_medium=email&utm_content=new-error&rapt=AEjHL4N4ZC9NXoBsdCWqD3aOSNnqUcr0XVDBL__orKN-_pb5MkU7o5wmVzMSG8PmBxquy8ObC3PC6lpwnuyhpTim7cNs7r1zPFIjeTrjrs9aHiV3diluPY0|https://console.cloud.google.com/errors/detail/CLr0p46-6e65Zg;time=P30D?project=pr-iot-thd&utm_source=error-reporting-notification&utm_medium=email&utm_content=new-error&rapt=AEjHL4N4ZC9NXoBsdCWqD3aOSNnqUcr0XVDBL__orKN-_pb5MkU7o5wmVzMSG8PmBxquy8ObC3PC6lpwnuyhpTim7cNs7r1zPFIjeTrjrs9aHiV3diluPY0]

This error can be fixed in one of two ways; adjusting the timeout length or (preferably) adjusting where imports are handled in the code. To adjust this in the code we need to move portions of our imports from the top level of the python file into the code for the individual tasks, please see the following Airflow document for details and explanations: 
[https://airflow.apache.org/docs/apache-airflow/2.2.5/best-practices.html#top-level-python-code|https://airflow.apache.org/docs/apache-airflow/2.2.5/best-practices.html#top-level-python-code|smart-link] 

Simply move any imports within the python callables that require them. If additional timeout time is needed, we can also perform that adjustment.

Include sample orders/vendors/queries/error logs/screenshots to support triage/resolution. Supporting documentation, if applicable, should be attached as well. 
{panel}

Many of the fields in NM detail page appears as NA so we needed to compare the API return attributes with the UI ones to make sure all attributes are correctly mapped. UI has been tested with Sample data and issue has been found in Master Archive table so DAG level changes will be needed.

Currently, there are two attributes in UI, not mapped correctly for which data appears in the email but not in the UI. They are:

# Effective cost Begin date
# Effective cost end date

Also check all the other attributes of the NM detail page to make sure everything got a proper mapping with API and the ‘NA’ is a true NA and not a missed attribute mapping.

Additionally, based on Vignesh’s initial investigation this looks like a data discrepancy issue. SKUs that has been sent out via email to l users have date value in one or more of the fields where as the same SKU seems to have NA value in the Master Archive table(which the UI dashboard gets the data from to display).

The UI has been tested out with sample data to see whether it could handle values other than NA and found it is working but it is the data discrepancy issue in the master archive table that is causing this which will need to be fixed at DAG level.

h2. Description of Work

h4. General description

Once a user saves a selection for KPI Slides, we need to record it in our account report table for use by bizdev, including the account segment, fiscal period the user chose, and if/which breakout slides are included. The scope of this story includes the following changes:

* Layout option opted in by users recorded in an additional column in the ‘lumiere_reports’ table
* A mapping/identifier to connect the option recorded in the table to the actual layout design.

The PATCH endpoint that updates a revision, returns a 500 error if the ""is_deleted"" field is not provided explicitly in the body; this shouldn't happen because ""is_deleted"" is an optional property for this endpoint. The issue could be caused by [this line of code|https://github.com/one-thd/ocm_ocp_routes-table-api/blob/develop/src/main/java/com/homedepot/routemanager/service/RouteManagerService.java#L351] since it's accessing a field that can be ""null"".
Also, the method updateRevisionByArtifact tries to update a revision that was previously edited by updateRevision. This isn’t breaking the functionality, but repeating actions.

Endpoint:

{{PATCH /v1/routes/{app_name}/revisions/{revision_id}}}


Solution:

# Make the endpoint able to update a revision without providing the optional field ""is_deleted"".
# Solve conflict between updateRevisionByArtifactName and updateRevision without changing functionality, keep consistency. "

The N-values can have a second Z, but Rule Engine support until the category section, so we only consider everything before the second Z and after that we don't account for any of the refinement.

Updates: 

The Harmony Team members don’t know what could we do about it. But David Graham gave the following options: 

# Can Vantage/Azure set the auth cookies (idToken, BearerToken, RefreshToken) with attribute {{SameSite=None;}} because Chrome now defaults to {{SameSite=Lax;}} and this means that Harmony won't Auth in iframe. We will ensure other protections make up for it (like CSP for iframe frame ancestor, CSP for cross-origin, CSRF token, etc).
# Harmony replaces the auth cookies given from Azure by adding {{SameSite=None}} itself right after auth callback.
# Vantage/Azure sets auth cookies to {{SameSite=None;}} but also adds {{Partitioned}} attribute to use CHIPS to control auth on embedded context (ie. iframe) to keep the added CSRF benefit like Chrome's default SameSite=Lax.
# Harmony replaces the auth cookies given from Azure by adding {{SameSite=None; Partitioned}} itself right after auth callback.

We prefer 1 or 2, because it means our users don't have to login twice (on Harmony website, and then in iframe context in CMS)."

[RELEASE] Fix malformed PPR/PPQ URLs within Apollo script,SEOIM-1364,SEOIM-1338,ENRIQUE CANEDO,enrique_canedo@homedepot.com,Done,"['SEOIM Q2 2024 Sprint 5', 'SEOIM Q3 2024 Sprint 2', 'SEOIM Q2 2024 Sprint 4', 'SEO IM Q3 2024 Sprint 4', 'SEOIM 2024 Q2 Sprint 2', 'SEOIM Q3 2024 Sprint 1', 'SEOIM Q2 2024 Sprint 6', 'SEOIM Q2 2024 Sprint 3', 'SEO IM Q3 2024 Sprint 3', 'SEO IM Q3 2024 Sprint 5']",,,,Medium,0,,"*Description:*

On PPR/PPQ URLs without a page number but with a trailing slash, Apollo scripts contain URLs with duplicate slashes before the page number, which result in empty 200 status pages. Google’s data shows that they are discovering the duplicate-slash URLs from PPR/PPQ URLs without a page number but with a trailing slash*.* We recommend updating the Apollo scripts to contain only canonical URLs, so that Google does not discover and rank empty status 200 pages.

*Current behavior:*

Google appears to be discovering a malformed, duplicate-slash URL pattern from crawling PPR/PPQ URLs without a page number but with a trailing slash. Example: [https://www.homedepot.com/p/reviews/Levolor-2-1-2-in-Real-Wood-Blinds-503438/205177115/|https://www.homedepot.com/p/reviews/Levolor-2-1-2-in-Real-Wood-Blinds-503438/205177115/] 

See that the malformed URL pattern with duplicate slashes before the page number is visible within two Apollo scripts.

Current example: ""/p/reviews/Levolor-2-1-2-in-Real-Wood-Blinds-503438/205177115//1\""

!image-20240412-132051.png|width=468,height=49,alt=""image-20240412-132051.png""!

!image-20240412-132100.png|width=468,height=37,alt=""image-20240412-132100.png""!

*Expected behavior:*

On PPR/PPQ URLs without a page number but with a trailing slash, Apollo scripts contain only canonical URLs instead of URLs with duplicate slashes.

Expected example: ""/p/reviews/Levolor-2-1-2-in-Real-Wood-Blinds-503438/205177115/1\""

Header Team - Update footer link to Store Locator ,SEOIM-1277,,ENRIQUE CANEDO,enrique_canedo@homedepot.com,In Progress,['SEO IM Q3 2024 Sprint 5'],,,,Medium,2,,"*Description:* 

[+SEOIM-874+|https://thd.atlassian.net/browse/SEOIM-874] will update the landing page for our store search and map functionality to `/l/store-locator`. Currently there are duplicate links to our store directory in the footer. We recommend updating one of these duplicate links to the new store locator landing page. 

*Current Behavior:* 

Footer contains duplicate link destinations: 

{{<a class=""sui-ml-1 md:sui-underline"" href=""/l/storeDirectory"" title=""Stores"" alt=""Stores"">Stores</a> }}

{{<a class=""sui-hidden md:sui-block sui-ml-1 md:sui-underline"" href=""/l/storeDirectory"" title=""Store Directory"" alt=""Store Directory"">Store Directory</a> }}

*Expected Behavior:* 

Once the page is created at `/l/store-locator`, the first link should be updated so that the destination is /l/store-locator and the anchor text is “Store Locator”. The “Store Directory” link should remain unchanged. 

{{<a class=""sui-ml-1 md:sui-underline"" href=""/l/store-locator"" title=""Stores"" alt=""Store Locator"">Store Locator</a> }}

{{<a class=""sui-hidden md:sui-block sui-ml-1 md:sui-underline"" href=""/l/storeDirectory"" title=""Store Directory"" alt=""Store Directory"">Store Directory</a> }}

*Acceptance Criteria:* 

As a user or bot, 

When I visit a homedepot.com  page, 

Then the footer contains a link to both the store locator and the store directory,

Fix malformed PPR/PPQ URLs within Apollo script,SEOIM-1265,SEOIM-1338,ENRIQUE CANEDO,enrique_canedo@homedepot.com,Removed,"['SEOIM Q2 2024 Sprint 5', 'SEOIM Q3 2024 Sprint 2', 'SEOIM Q2 2024 Sprint 4', 'SEOIM 2024 Q2 Sprint 2', 'SEOIM Q3 2024 Sprint 1', 'SEOIM Q2 2024 Sprint 6', 'SEOIM Q2 2024 Sprint 3']",,,,Medium,3,,"*Description:*

On PPR/PPQ URLs without a page number but with a trailing slash, Apollo scripts contain URLs with duplicate slashes before the page number, which result in empty 200 status pages. Google’s data shows that they are discovering the duplicate-slash URLs from PPR/PPQ URLs without a page number but with a trailing slash*.* We recommend updating the Apollo scripts to contain only canonical URLs, so that Google does not discover and rank empty status 200 pages.

*Current behavior:*

Google appears to be discovering a malformed, duplicate-slash URL pattern from crawling PPR/PPQ URLs without a page number but with a trailing slash. Example: [https://www.homedepot.com/p/reviews/Levolor-2-1-2-in-Real-Wood-Blinds-503438/205177115/|https://www.homedepot.com/p/reviews/Levolor-2-1-2-in-Real-Wood-Blinds-503438/205177115/] 

See that the malformed URL pattern with duplicate slashes before the page number is visible within two Apollo scripts.

Current example: ""/p/reviews/Levolor-2-1-2-in-Real-Wood-Blinds-503438/205177115//1\""

!image-20240412-132051.png|width=468,height=49,alt=""image-20240412-132051.png""!

!image-20240412-132100.png|width=468,height=37,alt=""image-20240412-132100.png""!

*Expected behavior:*

On PPR/PPQ URLs without a page number but with a trailing slash, Apollo scripts contain only canonical URLs instead of URLs with duplicate slashes.

Expected example: ""/p/reviews/Levolor-2-1-2-in-Real-Wood-Blinds-503438/205177115/1\""

*Acceptance criteria:*

As a bot,

When I visit PPR/PPQ URLs without a page number but with a trailing slash,

Then the duplicate slash URLs are replaced by canonical URLs,

In the DOM and source,

On mobile and desktop,

With JS on and off.

Double slash url’s need to be redirected to the 404 OOPs pages. Work with TE and Reliability Engineering to possibly set up rules so that anything the PPR/PPQ experience that has a double/multiple slash before the page number, it’s removed.

SuperSKU buttons cannot be linked due to PIP design and the fact that we don't bot-render above the fold.

* EMT-owned data source (similar to related categories)
* UX questions:
** Is this helpful to customer?
** Should the name change?
** Where should it be placed on the PIP?
** What content should display for users beyond the product/variant titles? Images? Pricing?

Regarding stencil migrations [this thread on slack|https://thdengops.slack.com/archives/C03CDA04UHL/p1705420006162289] that referenced a success criteria for stencil migration, noted below:

”…For those reasons we have added what is called stencil verification to harmony - basically it leverages eslint to run static analysis to make sure the following

# the harmony component is no longer using core-ui or other third party libraries for stencil components.
# the harmony component is no longer using custom classes in its source (other than a low threshold to account for edge cases).

On component release the github action workflows will run stencil verification and it will get logged in the harmony db. Currently we can run queries to get a list of components meeting stencil migration guidelines. In the future this will be represented directly in the harmony app ui. “

Update Breadcrumbs on Rental PIPs – Part 2,SEOIM-1108,SEOIM-1076,ENRIQUE CANEDO,enrique_canedo@homedepot.com,Done,"['SEOIM 2023 Q4 Sprint 3', 'SEOIM 2023 Q4 Sprint 4', 'SEOIM 2023 Q4 Sprint 5', 'SEOIM 2023 Q4 Sprint 6', 'SEOIM 2023 Q4 Sprint 2']",,,,Medium,2,,"*Description:*

Breadcrumbs provides a list of internal links that allows visitors and search engines to quickly navigate the site and better understand the site hierarchy. Using descriptive anchor text within the breadcrumb section helps provide additional context to the page the link is pointing to.

Rental breadcrumb text and links are managed manually at the product level. Each Rental PIP has a JSON file housed on GitHub used to build the page. The only way to change these pages is by updating the individual PIP files as needed.

On page 1 of PPQ, there is a mismatch between the number of Q&A’s we show on mobile vs. desktop for both users and bots. The mismatch on page 1 offsets each of the following pages, putting different content on each page depending on device. This means that Google could index content that would not be seen by the user if they visit from a different device type than Google used to index that URL. We recommend updating PPQ to show 8 Q&A’s per page on all pages so that the same content is rendered on each URL, regardless of device or user type.  

*Current Behavior:* 

* As a desktop user or bot, I see 4 Q&A’s per page on PPQ page 1 for any given product. The following pages have 8 Q&A’s per page. 
* As a mobile user or bot, I see 8 Q&A’s per page on all PPQ pages.

Remove Special Characters from PLP URLs – Trademark & Registered,SEOIM-1058,SEOIM-991,ENRIQUE CANEDO,enrique_canedo@homedepot.com,Done,"['SEOIM 2023 Q3 Sprint 6', 'SEOIM 2023 Q3 Sprint 4', 'SEOIM 2023 Q3 Sprint 5']",,,,Medium,2,,"*Description:*

To prevent confusion for bots and users, URLs should not contain special characters; such as the trademark (™) or registered (®) symbols.  When present the character should either be removed or properly encoded in the URL.  

*Current Behavior:*

PLPs that are refined to a value that includes a special character will use the exact value as part of the refined URL and canonical tag. This can make sharing a URL more difficult or send mixed signals to search engines when they see both the encoded and unencoded URL while crawling.

*Example URL*

*Expected Behavior:*

When a non-reserved special character is present in the URL it should not be included in the readable portion of URL. We have had previous stories related to special characters in the URL ([SEOIM-417|https://thd.atlassian.net/browse/SEOIM-417] & [SEOIM-876|https://thd.atlassian.net/browse/SEOIM-876]) but would like to establish a global PLP solution.

Update Breadcrumbs on Rental PIPs,SEOIM-1024,SEOIM-991,ENRIQUE CANEDO,enrique_canedo@homedepot.com,Done,"['SEOIM 2023 Q3 Sprint 6', 'SEOIM 2023 Q3 Sprint 4', 'SEOIM 2023 Q3 Sprint 5']",,,,Medium,3,,"*Description:*

Breadcrumbs provides a list of internal links that allows visitors and search engines to quickly navigate the site and better understand the site hierarchy. Using descriptive anchor text within the breadcrumb section helps provide additional context to the page the link is pointing to.

Rental breadcrumb text and links are managed manually at the product level. Each rental PIP has a JSON file housed on GitHub used to build the page. The only way to change these pages is by updating the individual PIP files as needed.

_Breadcrumb section of rental PIP file for 316822162_

*Current Behavior:*

On rental PIPs and rental reservation PIPs the breadcrumbs do not always use rental-specific language in the breadcrumb text.

*Expected Behavior:*

Breadcrumb data on rental PIPs should be updated to match the [accompanying mapping document|https://onedrive.homedepot.com/:x:/g/personal/gwenn_reinhart_homedepot_com/EUjmUj51OcFOvAYy0staZLgBpuq2wUXI78-2Au9bPFNisA?e=HNtwpR] (also attached) which provides the current URL and breadcrumb text and the new text. If the URL needs to be updated, that is provided as well.

Additionally, the last breadcrumb for all products currently links to itself with a trailing hash at the end. All these should be updated to remove the hash completely, but the label does not need to be updated.

*Breadcrumb Text (Will not change):* 36V Handheld Blower

*Current URL:* [https://www.homedepot.com/p/rental/Makita-36V-Handheld-Blower-XBU02PT-HD/316822162#|https://www.homedepot.com/p/rental/Makita-36V-Handheld-Blower-XBU02PT-HD/316822162#]

*Acceptance Criteria:*

As a user or bot,

When I land on a rental PIP

The breadcrumbs use targeted ‘rental’ text based on the provided mapping.

and

The final, self-referential breadcrumb does not include a # at the end of the URL.

Desktop and mobile

With JS on and off

 *Dev Notes:*

The json files in the rental repo’s can be overwritten (we do not need to keep an original copy)

Write a script so that when run locally, it updates all the objects in the json file. Then commit the changed/updated json but do not commit the script."
Update undefined values in LCP Schema markup - FE,SEOIM-964,SEOIM-653,ENRIQUE CANEDO,enrique_canedo@homedepot.com,Done,"['SEOIM 2023 Q3 Sprint 1', 'SEOIM 2023 Q2 Sprint 5', 'SEOIM 2023 Q2 Sprint 6', 'SEOIM 2023 Q2 Sprint 7']",,,,Medium,2,,"*Description:*

Currently on LCP pages, the breadcrumb Schema markup contains undefined values, which causes “undefined” to appear within search results. We recommend updating the undefined values to accurately reflect the breadcrumbs on the page.

!image-20230622-210413.png|width=468,height=238!

*Current Behavior:*

Within the BreadcrumbList Schema markup, breadcrumbs in positions 4 and 5 contain undefined in both the URL (`@id`) and the `name`.

        {

            ""@type"": ""ListItem"",

            ""position"": 4,

            ""item"": {

                ""name"": ""undefined"",

                ""@id"": ""[https://www.homedepot.com/l/undefined|https://www.homedepot.com/l/undefined]""

            }

        },

        {

            ""@type"": ""ListItem"",

            ""position"": 5,

            ""item"": {

                ""name"": ""undefined"",

                ""@id"": ""[https://www.homedepot.com/l/undefined/undefined|https://www.homedepot.com/l/undefined/undefined]""

            }

        }

*Expected Behavior:*

In position 4, the `name` is set to the state abbreviation as it appears within the breadcrumbs,

and the `@id` points to the state page within the store directory, as it does within the breadcrumbs.

 

In position 5, the `name` is set to the city as it appears within the breadcrumbs,

and the `@id` points to the local city page, as it does within the breadcrumbs.

 

Positions 1, 2 and 3 should not change.

 

Example for [https://www.homedepot.com/l/VA/Cumberland/VAVKVRgP|https://www.homedepot.com/l/VA/Cumberland/VAVKVRgP] 

        {

            ""@type"": ""ListItem"",

            ""position"": 4,

            ""item"": {

                ""name"": ""VA"",

                ""@id"": ""[https://www.homedepot.com/l/VA|https://www.homedepot.com/l/VA] ""

            }

        },

        {

            ""@type"": ""ListItem"",

            ""position"": 5,

            ""item"": {

                ""name"": ""Cumberland"",

                ""@id"": ""[https://www.homedepot.com/l/VA/Cumberland/VAVKVRgP|https://www.homedepot.com/l/VA/Cumberland/VAVKVRgP] ""

            }

        }

 

*Acceptance Criteria:*

As a bot,

When I visit a LCP,

Then the Schema markup accurately reflects the breadcrumbs on the page,

Show 30 reviews per page on PPS Review pages - BE,SEOIM-939,SEOIM-1076,ENRIQUE CANEDO,enrique_canedo@homedepot.com,Done,"['SEOIM 2023 Q3 Sprint 1', 'SEOIM 2023 Q3 Sprint 6', 'SEOIM 2023 Q3 Sprint 2', 'SEOIM 2023 Q4 Sprint 6', 'SEOIM 2023 Q2 Sprint 7', 'SEOIM 2023 Q4 Sprint 2', 'SEOIM 2023 Q3 Sprint 7', 'SEOIM 2023 Q4 Sprint 3', 'SEOIM 2023 Q4 Sprint 1', 'SEOIM 2023 Q4 Sprint 4', 'SEOIM 2023 Q4 Sprint 5', 'SEOIM 2023 Q2 Sprint 6', 'SEOIM 2023 Q3 Sprint 3', 'SEOIM 2023 Q3 Sprint 4', 'SEOIM 2023 Q3 Sprint 5']",,,,Medium,3,,"*Description:*

The number of reviews on PPS Reviews pages does not match the pagination descriptions shown on the page. We would like to update them so that we can consistently present accurate information to the user.

*Current Behavior:*

On PPS Review pages, the <div class=”pager__summary”> at the top of the list of reviews shows that 30 reviews are displayed on the page. The number of reviews that actually display on the page varies and usually appears to be around 25-30 reviews per page.

Example: [https://www.homedepot.com/l/Sandy-Springs/GA/Sandy-Springs/30328/154/reviews/1|https://www.homedepot.com/l/Sandy-Springs/GA/Sandy-Springs/30328/154/reviews/1|smart-link]

NOTE: the <div class=”pager__summary”> BELOW the list of reviews shows that 10 reviews are displayed on the page. This is incorrect and will be addressed in another story.

*Expected Behavior:*

PPS Review pages show 30 reviews per page and match the pagination counts within the first instance of <div class=”pager__summary”> above the list of reviews.

*Acceptance Criteria:*

As a user or bot,

When I visit any PPS Review page,

Then there are 30 reviews on the page,

And the reviews correspond with the pagination summary above the list of reviews,

In the DOM and source,

On mobile and desktop,

With JS on and off.

*Important Dev Observation:*

Per Enrique:

When I did some testing/research for this bug, I realized that regardless of the number of reviews that are sent as input parameter, the result will always be that number minus 7

30 will display 23
50 will display 43So maybe there is some kind of validation that evaluates some property of the Review object and those reviews are not displayed as part of the response we (BE) sent to the front end, or in some way the third party (BazaarVoice) consumed by this service is not working correctly when retrieving the reviews.

To prevent confusion for bots and users, URLs should not contain special characters; such as the degree symbol (°).  When present the character should either be removed or properly encoded in the URL.  

*Current Behavior:*

PLPs that are refined to a value that includes a special character will use the exact value as part of the refined URL and canonical tag. This can make sharing a URL more difficult or send mixed signals to search engines when they see both the encoded and unencoded URL while crawling.

As a bot, I need pages that are crawlable, indexable and relevant to a searcher’s query to serve the page in search results.

For all refinement values within the “Price” refinement, the ?NCNI-5 parameter appears within the link to the refined page and within the canonical tag on the refined page.

*Note*: Eager loading should only go on primary image, never in the secondary image.

*Note 2*: See if we can create a pre-release to set the eager loading - in *GM* experience and then run the performance tools (core web vitals) to see if it made any difference compared to PROD performance. If we see difference, then we can move forward and try to do that for the first loading. We’ll release to HDH first because there’s less traffic thereby less risk

Spike: How might we copy the GM Bundle Pod into the MA experience?,SEA2-418,SEA2-256,DANIELA VACA,daniela_vaca@homedepot.com,Done,"['SEA2 Sprint 5 Q3', 'SEA2 Sprint 4 Q3']",,,,Medium,2,,"Notes from grooming: both GM and MA have “bundle data model” in their custom pod wrappers. Presumably, this means that as soon as Commons is done bundle pods should start showing on PLPs. Per Jordan, we probably don’t need to do this as an export we can likely just put this in the product pod data model which is more efficient because it eliminates redundancies. Unlocks the ability to show bundles wherever more easily. 



*For this story, let’s double check that:*

* the bundle data model works the same for MA as it does for GM (likely a dependency on commons before we can check)
** deep dive what the data model does, and find/create documentation
** are there any unwanted ripple effects when added into ppod
** add harmony example with bundle mock to mimic MA bundle
* verify with commons and/or PEs that putting the data model in product pod and removing from the experiences is the best path - is it ok for performance?
** Henry Arockaj(?) - also ask him if/when the bundle flag will go live for MA
** PE is Goutham
* We have a solution for hiding KPFs on bundle pods
* bonus: see if we can play with this in stage to test
* document any work we need to do with tshirt size



*Description:* As part of the CSUS (Cross-Sell, Up-Sell) initiative, we need to get an MVP version of a Major Appliances bundle pod live. This type of pod already exists in Combo Tool Kits and can be identified by the fulfillment treatment:



!image-20240827-155239.png|width=241,height=635,alt=""image-20240827-155239.png""!

To find this, I searched “combo tool kits” and paginated until I found an example



For this story, we’ll research the feasibility of “copying and pasting” the current pod treatment into MA.

Walmart does this pretty well. Search for produce, pick a fruit/veggie, and increase to the max. Then search for that same fruit/veggie, and the quantity you selected will still be visible when the search results load

* for layout content-types
** app has 3 buttons - “Preview”, “Live Preview”, and “Live Page” (this one only shows if there is a parent page)
*** live preview - should get the parent slug if available; this gives the layout access to breadcrumbs and metadata
* for pages
** app has 1 button - “Live Page”
* change {{previewUrl}} field to use {{/c/}} or {{/a/}} programmatically based on the {{type}} or {{canonicalURL}} of the page's metadata



DoD - code complete

* functionality for each of the buttons above is complete
* present to team, Heather Meadows, and Heather Marrow for feedback
* the {{dev}}, {{stage}}, and {{master}} platforms are updated as needed - RFC required for master
* app bundle is uploaded to dev, stage, and master (2-3 separate instances) - RFC required

SPIKE: cache clear for content scheduling,MC-1770,MC-1767,ESMERALDA MENDOZA,esmeralda_mendoza1@homedepot.com,In Progress,[],,,,Medium,5,,"*The Background:* Our new structure allows users to add multiple layouts to a single page. Each layout can have its own DateRange which specifies when that layout should be live. (Some layouts will not have a date range.) With this structure, the page and any layouts that will be live must be published prior to the live date/time. This gives CIA access to the layout and dateRange data so that it can determine which layout to return to the front end to be rendered. Caching is set up to store a page for up to 4-6 hours.

*The Problem:* Currently (with one layout on a page), if a change anywhere on a page is published, the cache gets cleared, CIA makes a new call to get the new content, and the page is re-rendered with the updated change. Using dateRanges, however, this won’t be sufficient. If a new dateRange is set to apply at 07:00, but the cache was last cleared at 06:00, then that new layout won’t show up on the website until 10:00 or 12:00. Creative users are expecting a 15 min window from when they make the change to when it reflects in the browser.

*Possible Solutions:* 

* Set up a pub/sub that checks the Date Range content type in Contentful (only master (?))
** when the current date falls in or out of a date range, find the parent page and clear its cache
** Might also need to set up some sort of check so that the cache clear isn’t called too many times
* when content is published, capture the date range and use that to determine when to clear the cache next"

Show Buying choices based on the Fulfillment Api flags,PRO36-211,PRO36-59,JORGE PEREZ,jorge_perez@homedepot.com,Done,"['CatPaW 2024 Q3 Sprint 1', 'CatPaW 2024 Q3 Sprint 2']",,,,High,2,['PRO36-229'],"Background:
Currently the Buying Choices are show/hidden depending on the Assortment Commons. The issue is that Assortment Commons cannot be accurate decision by itself, a check needs to additional attributes from IDM and Product catalog. The Fulfillment API already have the checks for implemented. Therefore, we need to switch to use the flags from the Fulfillment API.

As a user I need to see the Buying choices shown/hidden accurately so I can choose the correct Fulfillments for our customers.

 Acceptance Criteria:
Show/Hide Buying Choices is based of the Fulfillment API flags as follow
*""scheduledEligible"" --> DFS*
*""unscheduledEligible"" --> STH*
*-""shipToStoreEligible"" --> STS (BOSS)-*
*""pickupEligible"" --> STS (BOSS)*
*-""pickupInStoreEligible"" --> BOPIS-*

*Buying Choices Logic*

{panel:bgColor=#deebff}
Seems that Orchestration service for now will only give 3 flags
*""scheduledEligible"" --> DFS*
*""unscheduledEligible"" --> STH*
*""pickupEligible"" --> STS (BOSS)*

Modified Logic (this only applies if *pickupInStoreEligible* flag does not come from response, otherwise +*use that flag*+ and ignore the logic)
*for [DFS and/or BOPIS]*
for BOPIS tumbling logic until we have the flag from Orchestration later
*pickupInStoreEligible = false*
if (storeInventory && storeInventory.unbufferedAvailability > 0) {
   *pickupInStoreEligible = true;*
}
If scheduledEligible or pickupInStoreEligible --> show *Local Inventory* card because we have data 


*for [STH and/or STS]*
If unscheduledEligible -or shipToStoreEligible- or pickupEligible -> show *Online* card because we have data for that [STH and/or STS]

Note: Remove current assortments logic for this and use these above logic instead

Bashar’s dev notes: Once you add a QC item from PIP to the Material List, then the item_type must be “qc-bridge-catalog” and then you use this flag (item_type) on the material list item to determine if it is QC item or not. If it is QC, then need to call the QC pricing endpoint on Orchestration

Call the new  Pricing endpoint!

h3. Background

For Phase 1, we want to allow PAEs to quote from the following catalogs:  Store Stock, Online Special Order

Below are other catalog types that we should allow visibility to and allow for adding to a list but not quoting:

* eCatalog aka Store Special Order
* Major Appliances
* Configurators 
* Special Edge cases 
** Live Goods
** Interior and Exterior Paint

_Note: Quote Center and HD Supply MRO is not included because those SKUs will be retrieved through a separate API._

We plan to let PAEs know they cannot quote the following catalogs: Major Appliances, Configurators, eCatalog, special edge cases (Paint, Live Goods) in their training documents. However, if they were to search for any of these items in ProAssist, they could. Therefore, we need to message the tool’s inability quote these catalogs.
{panel}

{panel:bgColor=#e3fcef}
h3. Acceptance Criteria

Given I am on the PIP for one of the following categories: Major Appliances, GCC Configurators, Interior Paint, Exterior Paint and Live Goods,
When I add the item to my list,
Then display a message on the line item (see supporting mock)

USE STENCIL UI: HELVETICA NEUE

*Testing Note:* The “catalog type” text should correspond with the item. Meaning if the user is on an Interior Paint item, then the text should display “Interior Paint”, etc.

h3. Acceptance Criteria

Given I am on Project Materials List,
When I have updated my Assortment ZIP Code,
Then a validation runs on the list to check whether the item is available to sell within that store  

Given I updated my Assortment ZIP Code and the validation check ran through my list,
When an item is unavailable to Sell in that store, 
Then a warning message with a yellow flag appears on that individual line item letting the User know “Item is unavailable in the selected store. To quote, replace with a valid product.” The Line item should also display limited information, with the information that is not hydrated showing as grayed out (see mocks for supporting visuals).

*Testing Note/Clarification*: The validation should only appear when the item is not available to sell at all. Meaning if it was available to sell through online (store 8119), then it should continue to be shown as available to sell.

When I select Change in the Localization area of the Search screen
Then I prompt a modal to Change Assortment ZIP Code

Given I have prompted the change Assortment ZIP Code Modal,
When I input a valid zip code and hit update,
Then the store closest to the zip code is reflected, and the search results populate from the updated store’s results 

Testing Note: Save Assortment ZIP so the list can reference it in the future.

Testing Note: Apply existing ZIP code validations in order to accept the ZIP code (basically make sure ZIP code is in the United States and valid)

For Phase 1, we want to allow PAEs to quote from the following catalogs:  Store Stock, Online Special Order

Below are other catalog types that we should allow visibility to and allow for adding to a list but not quoting:

We plan to let PAEs know they cannot quote the following catalogs: Major Appliances, Configurators, eCatalog, special edge cases (Paint, Live Goods) in their training documents. However, if they were to search for any of these items in ProAssist, they could. Therefore, we need to message the tool’s inability quote these catalogs.

The QC Bridge solution currently [+supports only 1 zip code+|https://thd.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/QCPNSOS/overview#Current-Capabilities]. They are also still figuring out and hashing out error codes. So for certain requests, we receive any errors – 400s or 500s. These error codes show up on our dashboard and are alerting the SREs. Until the QC Pipfigurator work is complete and supports all zip codes, there is no point in tracking the errors. To reduce unnecessary errors showing up for pro-assist, we will only call the QC Pipfigurator API for the supported zip code - {{98682}}.

These are the outlined Use Cases that Cam and I chatted through and when an orange box highlight should (or should not) appear. In bold is the only scenario when orange box highlight should appear:

# When a user searches something, nothing is highlighted
# when a product is added, then it's not highlighted because the toaster message appears and confirms the product has been added
# when a user searches something else, nothing is highlighted
# *when a user selects a resolved intent card, then it's highlighted and prompts the search experience (eventually PIP, but right now it's search)*

Currently system displays search results for invalid US zipcodes like 00000, 12345, 11111 etc., and allows user to resolve SKU from search result. We want to use the public store api to validate SKU results. This is system behavior that dotcom has adopted.

As a user, I want to input the zip code so that I can see the products available in the area and inventory to the closest store in that area

h3. Acceptance Criteria

Locate Public store API (an internal API)

Understand how it can connect with zip code (what does that mean? see below Gherkin)

Given I am on an editing page
When the zip code on a list or quote changes 
Then the new zip code displays AND nearest store to that zip code will return and populate inventory details based on that store

Note: Something I discovered is that there are ~45 zip codes that serve 2 stores so we will also need to look into whether supporting the full 9 digits of a zip would help the user localize to the right store.

Update Product Pod to Decouple Select and Added to Quote,PPS-1606,PPS-1417,JORGE PEREZ,jorge_perez@homedepot.com,Done,"['PPS CY23 Sprint 17 (Q4,2H)']",,,,Medium,5,,"Background

Today in LLC when a user searches for a product and adds to list/quote, they cannot re-add because the product card displays as Selected. However, this is a potential issue as resolving the SKU and adding the SKU to the list/quote is coupled. We would like to decouple this action by displaying a badge when an item is added to list/quote, while allowing the user to add that same item to list/quote.

As a PAE, I want to see when an item is added to my list/quote as a badge so that I can add the item to my list/quote again as needed.

h3. Acceptance Criteria

Given I have a quote open on the editing page and have prompted search
When a user adds a SKU to quote
Then a gray Added to Quote badge should appear AND Select functionality exists AND the user an add the same SKU to quote again

Testing: When an item is resolved, search the respective keyword. The following steps/instances should occur:

* System notifies user that it has been added to list via gray badge
* Item displays with an Orange “Select” CTA
* Ability to Select the item exists
** When the user selects the item a second time, a second intent card with resolved SKU will appear
** This action is repeatable (e.g. selects the same item a nth time, a nth intent card with resolved SKU will appear)

Note: this same behavior would show up on the “Add Intent” search bar and when a user selects the intent card

Because associates edit lists on a different website than customers, the PAE has two share links to send to the right audience. The first link is a dotcom link for pro customers. The second link is a PASE link for associates. If the recipient receives the incorrect link, then naturally they would not be able to view the link’s contents.

Given an associate clicks share, when the associates selects copy link for the pro, then the dotcom link will return and be copied to the clipboard

For Alpha 1.0, we are creating escape hatches at known points of failure. This one focuses what happens when a user needs to see more than the 12 results shown on PLP.

We will only display the top 12 results from enterprise search. Therefore, in the instances where more than 12 results were pulled back from the search call and the user scrolls to the bottom (presumably because they couldn’t find what they needed up top), we need an opportunity to tell users to try a new search query and/or direct users to OrderUp (through a new tab) to find the item they need in OrderUp. 

h3. User Story

As a user,
I want to see an option to view more products on OrderUp
So that I can find the right SKU to resolve my purchase intent

h3. Acceptance Criteria

* Remove pagination
* Text Condition: When there are 12 or less products returned from Search, then the text guidance at the bottom of the search results page should not appear (see mocked screen for specific text) 
* Text Condition: When there are more than 12 products returned from Search, then the text guidance should appear
* When Search Results return 12+ results, display “12 results” under zip code
* When Search results return fewer than 12 results, display the respective number of results (e.g. 4 results = “4 results”)

*User Story*

As a product manager, I want a user in the new PAE Portal to have the ability to select a pro company to work on behalf of, so that all users who are authorized to work on behalf of that pro company are able to see and benefit from that associate’s work. 

*Problem*

As a user in the new PAE Portal, when I try to select a customer via the CCUI module, I’m prompted to select a specific user at that company, rather than the company themselves.  
{panel}

{panel:bgColor=#e3fcef}
*Acceptance Criteria*

To be considered done, the following details will need to be documented in the PPS Technical Confluence Space and linked in the comments below: 

* Research findings on whether or not CCUI can give us the option to allow a user to select a pro company, without selecting a specific user at that company (i.e. similar to how it’s done on ProXtra vs. how it’s done on HOME)
** If this is not possible, determine steps and possible LOE to create this customized integration
* Outline how we might create our own company (account level) search and selection experience to match the PAE’s needs including:
** Effort / stories required
** Swag LOE for the requirements

*Dev Notes*

Based on a recent call, [~accountid:557058:df9bec29-4c7d-4d6d-8f73-39f0daa5f33a] may already have some good ideas on a customized module.  We also have a meeting with CCUI on {{2023-08-03}} that may shed light on some of these questions.

* *Please note that we want the majority of the logic to happen on the backend vs frontend logic.*

Complete EWR requirement for core logic address validation,LMPP-1399,,JORGE PEREZ,jorge_perez@homedepot.com,Done,"['Sprint 48', 'Sprint 49']",,,,Medium,5,,"*Background :*

(1) Addresses captured from FE apps are stored in Salesforce and we use this to check against a CoreLogic api to find out year built. This data is necessary for EWR (Environmental Work Rules) compliance. 

(2) Currently in 15% of the cases no year built is returned from the CoreLogic call because the address does not find a match in their database. When we do not get a year built we must assume it is pre-70s due to EPA laws and that drives a lot of paperwork. 

(3) CoreLogic claims if we use their api for address validation then more likely year built call will succeed reducing errors. Business keen to make the switch.

*Scope of work:*

All online forms ie SC, SO and SAM and across all program shall use CoreLogic api for address validation. Override address functionality will still continue. 

*Current functionality* - SAM and SOT use different methods for address validation today. On SOT we use google type ahead functionality that is underneath the hood validating the address. On SAM we use google type ahead on FE but after we call URS, the URS api once again does an address validation and recommended replacements are then presented in a modal for customer. URS uses Bing for its address validation (via StoreSearchServices). In both cases customer is always allowed to override address.

*Requirements :*

Create an address component that checks for the existence of the address on the coreLogic database using the typeahead api. If there’s a match, allow the user to move forward, If not, show the modal with a suggested address.



Requirement 1 - Unify SOT and SAM experience. For all address components on SO and SC, provide typeahead in lead forms using Google api (Existing functionality and no change). When customer clicks “Next” on Address Step, perform “Address validation” using CoreLogic API  where address recommendations would be provided to the customer including an option to keep the address typed. Use same UI as SAM.

Requirement 2- The changes will be applicable to one pilot program only. And code shall have flexibility to expand to other program as needed.

 Requirement 3 -We will switch the api doing the validation from Bing to CoreLogic in SAM.

Requirement 4 - Create Mixpanel events to track -

# Address suggestion showed to customer 
# Customer selected one of the recommended addresses
# Customer by-passed the recommended address

Requirement 5  - Add the same tracking of the new component as done today for URS

*Testing :*

# got to “Pilot Program” 
# Start filling the lead form 
# when you come at Address step, ensure that type ahead works 
# If address validation API returns some suggestions then show address recommendation pop-up with same UI as SAM. customer typed address or customer selected one of the proposed address shall be submitted to DAS.
# Allow customer to select a proposed address or bypass
# If address validation API does not return any suggestions then let customer go to next step and customer typed address shall be submitted to DAS.

*Success Criteria :*

# The “yearbuild” value returned by CoreLogic API shall go above 85% by “X %”
# The lead submission rate shall not drop below “y%”"

Description: 
Given I am a bot
When I crawl a Home Services Lead Generation SKU PIP
I should be able to discover copy and links within the lead form component without executing JS and/or rendering the page
So That I can quickly and easily access valuable content and links

Currently, Lead Forms for Lead Generation SKUs/PIPs render client side. 
•	Example: https://www.homedepot.com/p/Carrier-Installed-Comfort-Series-Packaged-Hybrid-Heat-System-HSINSTCARCPHHS/300175814 

Benefit: Not all search engines can render JS; Google won’t always have resources to do so.
“… where the initial HTML does not contain the actual content and Googlebot needs to execute JavaScript before being able to see the actual page content that JavaScript generates … Once Googlebot’s resources allow … server-side or pre-rendering is still a great idea because it makes your website faster for users and crawlers, and not all bots can run JavaScript.”
Source: https://developers.google.com/search/docs/guides/javascript-seo-basics 

Expected Outcome: Content and links in the Lead Gen. SKU Lead Form are rendered server-side and are visible in the URL’s page source.

Success:
As a user
When I visit a Home Services Lead Generation SKU PIP on any device
I should be able to find content and links in Lead Form in the page source of the URL using the following steps:
-	Right click, View Page Source
-	Ctrl + F and search for sample text within the Lead Form

Contentful: new innervate field for RevJetModule,MC-1942,AME-3745,ISAAC FIMBRES,isaac_fimbres@homedepot.com,Finalizada,[],,,,Medium,2,,"Working name to be finalized in discussion with CR: “innervateCarouselIndex”

see [https://thd.atlassian.net/browse/AME-3992|https://thd.atlassian.net/browse/AME-3992|smart-link] 

the content model for RevJetModule needs a new field.

The purpose of this field is to act as a secondary identifier. When creative works in innervate, different pieces of an innervate hero carousel will be grouped under one tag, and this new field will differentiate between those pieces.

This field should not be required, as not all pieces of innervate hero content will be in carousels.

For now, the value should just be like {{`'1', '2', '3'`}} etc and be manually managed by the contentful user. While it is kinda like an array index, it really is more of a secondary id.

Live preview helps digital teams quickly and confidently fine-tune content, leading to

* Increased efficiency by finding and editing content faster
* Higher content quality and less re-work
* Reduced onboarding and training by making the editorial experience more intuitive

Out of the box, live preview offers an intuitive side-by-side edit and preview experience. Content fields appear on the left, and a preview of the page appears on the right. Customers can change the preview viewport from full-width desktop to a narrow-width mobile view.

When developers integrate our [live preview SDK|https://github.com/contentful/live-preview] into your web site, it unlocks two additional capabilities for content editors:

* Real-time updates in the preview pane: Test different copy variants and see their effect as you type.
* Inspector mode: Find and edit specific content faster by clicking on any tagged field in the preview pane.

How will we do this:

Postman has a testing capability that can be integrated into our CI. Using already added environments and the collection added by this [PR|https://thd.atlassian.net/browse/MC-904]. This should be run when we create PRs (if possible) and when creating releases (Mandatory). If any of the calls fails then the PR/Release cannot go through. 

Tests should use testing content that we control and will not change except for when larger content model changes occur. We should not have a creative decision affect our tests. Error messages should also be descriptive.

The issue is that for B2C, the “Check Order Status” link is hard-coded to the my account [*guest*|https://www.homedepot.com/myaccount/guest-order-tracking][-order-tracking link|https://www.homedepot.com/myaccount/guest-order-tracking].

If I am an authenticated B2C user and click on the “Check Order Status” link, I would expect to be taken to the [myaccount/purchase-history link|https://www.homedepot.com/myaccount/purchase-history] where I can track my order.I believe that the B2C “Check Order Status” footer option front end code should be conditional instead of hard-coded to the *guest* tracking form link.

Promotion Products needs 3 props passed in:

# {{type}} = card
# {{customerId}} (not implemented yet, MCVSID??)
# {{onFail}} = callback function to denote there is no BOGO, should be used to display PromotionFallback element

*– Note from Katie –* 

Mick: making a call over here that we won’t go for option 2 for that additional ‘location icon’

I'm thinking for a UX fix on this we can do one of the following:

* once the user taps “Use Current Location”, it then autofocuses to the first new store card below the input field.
* additionally, an indicator into the input field while the “use current location” is in use
option 1: autofocus only
Option 2: autofocus + location icon and “current location” in color in the input field
option 3: autofocus + “Current Location” in the input field (no color change or icon) - this option might be more feasible than option 2
*the teal color would need to be vetted with ops, so if we go with option 2 we may need to just stick with either back or orange. teal is for information

@Mick Panyanithisakul - Still seeing the zip code validation error -- it does seem to validate it you click ""search"" vs. update. But if ""update"" is selected, it just closes and does not update. Do you know if this one is being looped into other zip code issues?

As a PM
*I want * the ability to set the minimum number of products required for a given location to render
*So that * I can finely control the rendering of the sponsored carousel from the backend

*Acceptance Criteria*

Scenario: 
Given the {{location-config}} exists in the {{application.yaml}} of the {{pla-sponsored-api}}
When updates are made to the {{list-config}} for all plaLocation configurations
Then a new property called {{minProductsToRender}} or similar is added with a default value and channel specific value overridden as needed. (See Notes for example)

Scenario:
Given the new plaLocation list config property has been set up
When a carousel graphQL is made to the {{pla-sponsored-api}} for a plaLocation with a configured {{minProductsToRender}}
Then the {{minProductsToRender}} value is evaluated for the requested channel and no products are returned such that the sponsored carousel does not render if their are fewer auctioned products than the configured minimum number of products to render

Scenario:
Given the new plaLocation list config property has been set up
When a carousel graphQL is made to the {{pla-sponsored-api}} for a plaLocation without a configured {{minProductsToRender}}
Then the {{minProductsToRender}} value is NOT evaluated and no changes are made to the returned auction winners

Scenario:
Given the {{minProductsToRender}} config is set up and causes the response to be truncated such that the sponsored carousel does not render
When the ad funnel metrics are evaluated
Then it is confirmed that this edge case is being tracked appropriately and the behavior is documented

*Notes:*

* Initially the DZ plaLocation should be the only location with a {{minProductsToRender}} configuration specified
** Desktop - 6
** Tablet - 6
** Mobile - 3
** Mobile Consumer - 3
* Current behavior is hard coded in the Ranker decorator to only return no products when fewer than 6 products are returned regardless of the channel, specifically for the DZ plaLocation. This should be replaced with the more robust plaLocation based implementation.

pla-sponsored-api - dynamic recs - refactor FBT Decorator Into DynamicRecs Decorator,RMTF-415,RMTF-392,FRANCISCO RAMIREZ,francisco_ramirez2@homedepot.com,Done,['RMTF Sprint 29'],,,,Medium,5,,"*Why*

As an engineer
*I want * to refactor FBT_Decorator and its related services/processors
*So that * I can use any model from dynamic recs on an ad location with just configs

*Acceptance Criteria*

Scenario: FBT Ad Location
Given the product details pla (pla on pip) requires using FBT and is using the refactored Dynamic Recs Decorator
When processing a request for an ad at that location
Then the process uses configuration to determine which endpoint to use for Dynamic Recs (fbt,pip_alternatives, or any other endpoint needed in future)

Scenario: PIP Alternatives Ad Location
Given an ad location requires using PIP Alternatives and is using the refactored Dynamic Recs Decorator
When processing a request for an ad at that location
Then the process uses configuration to determine which endpoint to use for Dynamic Recs (fbt,pip_alternatives, or any other endpoint needed in future)

Scenario: FBT and PIP Alternatives Ad Location
Given an ad location requires using FBT, PIP Alternatives and is using the refactored Dynamic Recs Decorator
When processing a request for an ad at that location
Then the process uses configuration to determine which endpoint to use for Dynamic Recs (fbt,pip_alternatives, or any other endpoint needed in future)

And calls to dynamic recs are asynchronous for category finder or promoteiq to get results later

example on right of diagram:

!target sourcing feature - Page 4-20240430-133020.png|width=9775,height=2908,alt=""target sourcing feature - Page 4-20240430-133020.png""!

*Notes:*

We want to try and keep our code flexible so we can easily implement future asks. Since we currently have FBT, and are being asked to use PIP Alternatives - we want to make this decorator applicable to use any Dynamic Recs endpoint and switch on configuration.

*PIP Alternatives Example*

[{color:#ffffff}https://api.edge-pr.homedepot.com/dynamicrecs/pip_alternatives?storeId=121&key=7RxPI0vWHFrcm7N6zfiA236zf2dnG454&anchor=204143694{color}|https://api.edge-pr.homedepot.com/dynamicrecs/pip_alternatives?storeId=121&key=7RxPI0vWHFrcm7N6zfiA236zf2dnG454&anchor=204143694]

*Suggestion to make the decorator more configuration driven*

Given the Dynaic recs api is similar on what endpoints it needs, and the dynamic pieces required are only the endpoint, store id, and anchor - we can we can approach it like this

||*required dynamic variable*||*can comes from*||
|anchor|itemId field in graphql request|
|store id|storeId in graphql request|
|endpoint|from configuration|

*Example PLA Location config with Dynamic Recs*

[Carousel] Move telemetry logic to a hook,RMTF-180,,FRANCISCO RAMIREZ,francisco_ramirez2@homedepot.com,Done,"['RMTF Sprint 16', 'RMTF Sprint 15', 'RMTF Sprint 14']",,,,Medium,3,,"h1. 📗 Summary

We need to keep the Carousel base code simple, so it can be easily read and understood. We want to move the current code, that calculates and triggers telemetry events to New Relic, from the Carousel component to a custom React hook.

Currently, the telemetry events are produced in one of the following ways:

* Through a {{useEffect}} hook, which is activated when the dependency variables change.
** Example: the variables {{loading}}, {{error}} or {{data}} changes.
* By calling a {{useCallback}} hook, which is invoked in response to a Carousel’s event.
** Example: the user makes a slide in the carousel.

These {{useEffect}} and {{useCallback}} hooks can be moved to a *custom React hook*, from where they would be invoked, keeping the same functionality but with the following advantages:

* The Carousel component is freed from telemetry logic details, which are unrelated to how the Carousel is rendered (separation of concerns).
* The Carousel component code becomes simpler and easier to read.
* Additionally, the telemetry logic, being moved into a custom hook, becomes easier to read as well.

h1. 
As a:  Developer 

*I Want to:* Create a new React custom hook to hold the telemetry logic that currently lives in the Carousel component.

*So that*: We can replace the telemetry code currently in the Carousel component, with a call to the new hook.

h1. 📋 : Acceptance Criteria

{panel:bgColor=#e3fcef}
h4. Acceptance Criteria 1

*Given* custom React hooks can contain and run other hooks, just like a React component does (but without rendering any HTML). 
*Then* 

* *A new custom hook has been created* *and holds all the telemetry logic.*
* The telemetry logic in the new hook should be equivalent to the telemetry logic currently in the Carousel.
* The telemetry logic in the Carousel has been replaced with a call to the new custom hook.
{panel}

{panel:bgColor=#e3fcef}
h4. Acceptance Criteria 2

*Given* unit tests exist to validate that telemetry events are calculated and triggered correctly,
*When* the telemetry logic has been moved to the new custom hook,
*Then* all the existing unit tests should pass without additional changes.
{panel}

{panel:bgColor=#deebff}
h4. Notes

* Choose a meaningful name for the custom hook, e.g. {{useSponsoredCarouselTelemetry}}.
* The new hook input parameters should include all the dependency variables needed by the current hooks that calculates and triggers the telemetry events.
* The new hook output should include the callbacks needed to trigger telemetry events in response to a Carousel event.

We need to implement new metrics in our carousel to be able to determine:

* *Out of the total number of carousels not loaded:*
** How many did not load because an *error* ocurred in the graphql call (bad request).
** How many did not load because the graphql call returned *0 products*.
** How many did not load because there were *0 products* left after the carousel’s filtering logic.
** How many did not load because the {{renderNewCarousel}} *flag is false.*



* *Out of the total number of filtered products:*
** How many were filtered by the plaModel graphql api.
** How many were filtered by the carousel’s filtering logic.

** {{error_from_graphql}} - An error ocurred in the graphql call to the plaModel.
** {{zero_products_from_graphql}} - The graphql call to plaModel returned 0 products.
** {{zero_products_after_filtering}} - There are 0 products left after the carousel’s internal filtering process.

Carousel - Old Carousel - Remove Custom Impression Logic,RMTF-101,RMTF-77,FRANCISCO RAMIREZ,francisco_ramirez2@homedepot.com,Done,['RMTF Sprint 9'],,,,Medium,3,,"h1. Reason

We want to use Nucleus version of impression instead of a custom one to reuse logic among all PLAs

h1. Acceptance Criteria

*Given* ProductPod has impression implementation by Nucleus, *When* sponsored-content impression logic removed from carousel, *Then* impressions still work since it’s part of ProductPod

*Given* banners still use custom impression logic, *Then* it will continue to do so after this story

We should use a wrapper with a feature switch to have the capability of deploying our carousel implementation into the Nucleus experience without it being used yet. This way, we can turn it on when we’re ready without having to do a code deployment.

h1. Acceptance Criteria

*Given* old and new Sponsored Carousel Exists, *When* feature switch is implemented and turned off, *Then* the OLD carousel should display in the harmony chapter

*Given* old and new Sponsored Carousel Exists, *When* feature switch is implemented and turned on, *Then* the NEW carousel should display in the harmony chapter

*Given* Wrapper is implemented, *When* we’re ready to remove the wrapper, *Then* it should be easy for the developer

h1. Notes

We should use the {{useConfigService}} hook as a means for the feature switch, it pulls configs from REHub for the components to use

Update integration test bash script,NRM-2109,,FRANCISCO RAMIREZ,francisco_ramirez2@homedepot.com,Done,[],,,,Medium,,,"*Why*

* Currently, the integration test bash script reports the status of the tests (displays the output of the jest command)... but in the end, after having executed the tests, the script returns with the status 0 (0 means success) either when we have all the tests passed or when there are some failed.
** See the image below:

!image-20230316-004442.png|width=3374,height=1284!

* After a change in the logic of some module that causes some tests to fail, *we need to update the tests to reflect the new expected behavior* (as part of the same PR we are trying to merge).
* Because of this, *we should modify the integration test bash script to return a failed status when we have some tests failed*, this way we make sure the tests are updated as part of the PR.

*Acceptance Criteria*

* The integration test bash script should return a fail status when some integration tests fail.
* Fix the integration test that is currently failing for the {{User Repository}} module."

Campaign Evolution Channel Repository: Write new integration tests,NRM-1977,,FRANCISCO RAMIREZ,francisco_ramirez2@homedepot.com,Done,[],,,,Medium,,,"h1. *Why*

* We have [new guidelines|https://confluence.homedepot.com/display/MRM/Testing+Guidelines] for the implementation of unit tests (these guidelines are also applicable to integration tests).
* We have a [new approach|https://thd.atlassian.net/browse/NRM-1851] that allows us to use a Postgres DB instance, running in a Docker container, in our integration tests.

Given the above points:

* New integration tests for the  *Campaign Evolution Channel Repository* module are required, whose implementation is aligned to the newly established guidelines, and whose DB interactions are carried out on a Postgres DB instance running in a Docker container, properly migrated and seeded.

h1. *Task description*

h2. Target file

* {{/src/repository/campaign/CampaignEvolutionChannelRepository.js}}

h2. Scope

Currently, we don't have integration tests that are aligned {{with}} the points mentioned above, so we need to implement tests for all the methods of the *Campaign Evolution Channel Repository* *module*:

{noformat}query
mapResultsToEntity
all
allWhere
update{noformat}

h2. Tests location

* Create the following directory structure and write the new tests in the {{CampaignEvolutionChannelRepository.i.test.js}} file.

{noformat}src/test/integration/tests
├── repository
    └── CampaignEvolutionChannelRepository.i.test.js{noformat}

h2. Mocks location

* Create the following directory structure and place any mock required by the new tests in the {{CampaignChannel.mocks.js}} file.

{noformat}src/test/mock/data/campaign/repository
└──CampaignEvolutionChannel.mocks.js{noformat}

h2. Writing the tests

* The new tests should follow the new testing guidelines and should make use of a {{Knex}} instance connected to the {{Postgres DB}} instance running in a Docker container, configured for integration testing purposes.

 Example:

{noformat}const modelRepository = require('../../../../repository/model-repository');
const loadDb = require('../../db/connection');
const mocks = require('../../../mock/data/model/repository/model.mocks');

/**
 * @type {Knex}
 */
let db = null;

describe('Model Repository Tests', () => {
  beforeAll(async () => {
    db = await loadDb()
      .catch((error) => {
        console.error('#Error @beforeAll() DB could not be loaded.');
        throw error;
      });
  });

h2. Defining mocks & expected data

h3. Knex mock

Make use of the new approach we have to create a {{Knex}} mock. This approach mainly consists of 3 parts:

# Query builder mock.
## Object containing sets of mock functions, which represent query builder’s methods.
## A set of mock functions should be defined for each table that is queried in the target function.
## Each mock function should return {{this}} object, so the methods can be chained together, just like {{Knex}} does.
## Each set of mock functions should include a {{then}} method that resolves to the desired result.
# DB mock: 
## Mock function that accepts a table’s name and returns the corresponding set of mock functions for the given table’s name.
# Query builder expected arguments mock.
## This is an utility object where we define the expected arguments for each mock function in the query builder.

The following example shows how we can use this approach given a simple query, however, this same approach can be extended to mock more complex queries.

*Example:*

* Given the following query:

{noformat}const records = await db('model')
      .insert(modelDetail)
      .returning(['id', 'name']);{noformat}

* The corresponding {{Knex}} mocks should be:

{noformat}/**
 * Query builder mock.
 */
createModel1.queryBuilder = {
  model: {
    insert: jest.fn().mockReturnThis(),
    returning: jest.fn().mockReturnThis(),
    then(resolve) { resolve(createModel1.queryResult); },
  },
};

/**
 * Expected args for query builder's methods.
 */
createModel1.queryBuilderArgs = {
  model: {
    insert: createModel1.modelDetail,
    returning: ['id', 'name'],
  },
};

/**
 * DB mock.
 */
createModel1.db = jest.fn().mockImplementation(
  (tableName) => createModel1.queryBuilder[tableName],
);{noformat}

* The target *Repository method* itself should be inspected to confirm the {{shape}} of the data it returns.
* Also, at development time, we can print the data returned by the method being tested (using the console or a debugger), so we can observe what the current returned data is.
* Any inspection to confirm the {{shape}} of the data returned by {{Knex}}, should not be performed on the result of a {{Knex}} mock (because in this case, the result is also a mock defined by us), but on the result returned by a {{Knex}} connected to a real DB instance (e.g. a development or testing Postgres DB instance).

h3. {color:#0747a6}Important:{color}

* If there is any doubt about how a mock should be defined or the shape of the resulting data, we need confirmation from the Nova team.

h2. Assertion of the expected results.

To thoroughly validate that {{Knex}} queries are built and executed as expected, we need the following assertions:

# Assert the expected result returned by the target function.
# Assert the expected number of calls of each {{Knex}} mock function.
# Assert the expected arguments with which each {{Knex}} mock function was called.

*Example:*

* Given the following query:

{noformat}const records = await db('model')
      .insert(modelDetail)
      .returning(['id', 'name']);{noformat}

* The corresponding assertions should be:

{noformat}/* -- Assert -- */
      // result
      expect(result).toEqual(expectedResult);

      // model
      // -----
      expect(db).toHaveBeenCalledTimes(1);
      expect(db).toHaveBeenCalledWith('model');

      expect(queryBuilder.model.insert).toHaveBeenCalledTimes(1);
      expect(queryBuilder.model.insert).toHaveBeenCalledWith(queryBuilderArgs.model.insert);

      expect(queryBuilder.model.returning).toHaveBeenCalledTimes(1);
      expect(queryBuilder.model.returning).toHaveBeenCalledWith(queryBuilderArgs.model.returning);
      // --{noformat}

h3. {color:#0747a6}Important:{color}

* Since these assertions are the key element that helps us confirm the correct operation of the target functions, we need to take the _""permissive""_ sense of the word _“should”_ in the following statement of the guidelines:
** _“Every test scenario should have only 1 assertion (expect)”_

    });

h2. Defining mocks & expected data

h3. Knex mock

Make use of the new approach we have to create a {{Knex}} mock. This approach mainly consists of 3 parts:

# Query builder mock.
## Object containing sets of mock functions, which represent query builder’s methods.
## A set of mock functions should be defined for each table that is queried in the target function.
## Each mock function should return {{this}} object, so the methods can be chained together, just like {{Knex}} does.
## Each set of mock functions should include a {{then}} method that resolves to the desired result.
# DB mock: 
## Mock function that accepts a table’s name and returns the corresponding set of mock functions for the given table’s name.
# Query builder expected arguments mock.
## This is an utility object where we define the expected arguments for each mock function in the query builder.

The following example shows how we can use this approach given a simple query, however, this same approach can be extended to mock more complex queries.

*Example:*

* Given the following query:

{noformat}const records = await db('model')
      .insert(modelDetail)
      .returning(['id', 'name']);{noformat}

* The corresponding {{Knex}} mocks should be:

{noformat}/**
 * Query builder mock.
 */
createModel1.queryBuilder = {
  model: {
    insert: jest.fn().mockReturnThis(),
    returning: jest.fn().mockReturnThis(),
    then(resolve) { resolve(createModel1.queryResult); },
  },
};

/**
 * Expected args for query builder's methods.
 */
createModel1.queryBuilderArgs = {
  model: {
    insert: createModel1.modelDetail,
    returning: ['id', 'name'],
  },
};

/**
 * DB mock.
 */
createModel1.db = jest.fn().mockImplementation(
  (tableName) => createModel1.queryBuilder[tableName],
);{noformat}

h3. Data mocks

* The *DB’s schema* should be inspected to confirm the {{name}} and {{type}} of the data mock properties we send as input to the repository method.

h3. Expected data.

* The target *Repository method* itself should be inspected to confirm the {{shape}} of the data it returns.
* Also, at development time, we can print the data returned by the method being tested (using the console or a debugger), so we can observe what the current returned data is.
* Any inspection to confirm the {{shape}} of the data returned by {{Knex}}, should not be performed on the result of a {{Knex}} mock (because in this case, the result is also a mock defined by us), but on the result returned by a {{Knex}} connected to a real DB instance (e.g. a development or testing Postgres DB instance).

h3. {color:#0747a6}Important:{color}

* If there is any doubt about how a mock should be defined or the shape of the resulting data, we need confirmation from the Nova team.

h2. Assertion of the expected results.

To thoroughly validate that {{Knex}} queries are built and executed as expected, we need the following assertions:

# Assert the expected result returned by the target function.
# Assert the expected number of calls of each {{Knex}} mock function.
# Assert the expected arguments with which each {{Knex}} mock function was called.

*Example:*

* Given the following query:

{noformat}const records = await db('model')
      .insert(modelDetail)
      .returning(['id', 'name']);{noformat}

* The corresponding assertions should be:

{noformat}/* -- Assert -- */
      // result
      expect(result).toEqual(expectedResult);

      // model
      // -----
      expect(db).toHaveBeenCalledTimes(1);
      expect(db).toHaveBeenCalledWith('model');

      expect(queryBuilder.model.insert).toHaveBeenCalledTimes(1);
      expect(queryBuilder.model.insert).toHaveBeenCalledWith(queryBuilderArgs.model.insert);

h2. Defining mocks & expected data

h3. Knex mock

Make use of the new approach we have to create a {{Knex}} mock. This approach mainly consists of 3 parts:

# Query builder mock.
## Object containing sets of mock functions, which represents query builder’s methods.
## A set of mock functions should be defined for each table that is queried in the target function.
## Each mock function should return the {{this}} object, so the methods can be chained together, just like {{Knex}} does.
## Each set of mock functions should include a {{then}} method that resolves to the desired result.
# DB mock: 
## Mock function that accepts a table’s name and returns the corresponding set of mock functions for the given table’s name.
# Query builder expected arguments mock.
## This is an utility object where we define the expected arguments for each mock function in the query builder.

The following example shows how we can use this approach given a simple query, however, this same approach can be extended to mock more complex queries.

*Example:*

* Given the following query:

{noformat}const records = await db('model')
      .insert(modelDetail)
      .returning(['id', 'name']);{noformat}

* The corresponding {{Knex}} mocks should be:

{noformat}/**
 * Query builder mock.
 */
createModel1.queryBuilder = {
  model: {
    insert: jest.fn().mockReturnThis(),
    returning: jest.fn().mockReturnThis(),
    then(resolve) { resolve(createModel1.queryResult); },
  },
};

/**
 * Expected args for query builder's methods.
 */
createModel1.queryBuilderArgs = {
  model: {
    insert: createModel1.modelDetail,
    returning: ['id', 'name'],
  },
};

/**
 * DB mock.
 */
createModel1.db = jest.fn().mockImplementation(
  (tableName) => createModel1.queryBuilder[tableName],
);{noformat}

h3. Data mocks

* The *DB’s schema* should be inspected to confirm the {{name}} and {{type}} of the data mock’s properties we send as input to the repository method.

h3. Expected data.

* The target *Repository method* itself should be inspected to confirm the {{shape}} of the data it returns.
* Also, at development time, we can print the data returned by the method being tested (using the console or a debugger), so we can observe what the current returned data is.
* Any inspection to confirm the {{shape}} of the data returned by {{Knex}}, should not be performed on the result of a {{Knex}} mock (because in this case the result is also a mock defined by us), but on the result returned by a {{Knex}} connected to a real DB instance (e.g. a development or testing Postgres DB instance).

h3. {color:#0747a6}Important:{color}

* If there is any doubt about how a mock should be defined or what the shape of the resulting data should be, we need to get confirmation from the Nova team.

h2. Assertion of the expected results.

To thoroughly validate that {{Knex}} queries are built and executed as expected, we need the following assertions:

# Assert the expected result returned by the target function.
# Assert the expected number of calls of each {{Knex}} mock function.
# Assert the expected arguments with which each {{Knex}} mock function was called.

*Example:*

* Given the following query:

{noformat}const records = await db('model')
      .insert(modelDetail)
      .returning(['id', 'name']);{noformat}

* The corresponding assertions should be:

{noformat}/* -- Assert -- */
      // result
      expect(result).toEqual(expectedResult);

      // model
      // -----
      expect(db).toHaveBeenCalledTimes(1);
      expect(db).toHaveBeenCalledWith('model');

      expect(queryBuilder.model.insert).toHaveBeenCalledTimes(1);
      expect(queryBuilder.model.insert).toHaveBeenCalledWith(queryBuilderArgs.model.insert);

      expect(queryBuilder.model.returning).toHaveBeenCalledTimes(1);
      expect(queryBuilder.model.returning).toHaveBeenCalledWith(queryBuilderArgs.model.returning);
      // --{noformat}

h3. {color:#0747a6}Important:{color}

* Since these assertions are the key element that helps us confirm the correct operation of the target functions, we need to take the _""permissive""_ sense of the word _“should”_ in the following statement of the guidelines:
** _“Every test scenario should have only 1 assertion (expect)”_

When a trailer is checked in without an appointment, we send a check in message to WMS with no-appointment style of check in and then they create an appointment send that to HDY. HDY links that appointment to the same trailer at this point.

For some reason if we don’t get an appointment push from them and we move the trailer within HDY, we will not be sending the {{trailer_move}} event to WMS as we still don't have an appointment associated with that trailer yet. As a result we have out of sync conditions.

*The proposed fix:*

We need to block the trailer move till we receive an appointment from WMS for that trailer.

Enhance blocked reasons logic in switcher engine to verify whether the yard visit has appointments associated with that or not and add the new blocked reason - {{No Appointment associated with Trailer}} 

This has to be done only if the DC is a a DFC.

*Tech Notes:*

# Call yard-core’s {{/api/yard/distribution-centers/{dcNumberList}}} endpoint to get DC Details for that DC, Make it cacheable
# Update {{YardVisit}} dto to include List<Appointment>  {{yardVisitAppointmentList}} to hold the response of {{getYardVisitsForMoves}} method
# Determine dcType ({{BuildingType}} from yard core) and if it is DFC, verify if the yardVisit has appointments or not. If no appointments are available add that as a blocked reason in {{findTasksBlockedByYardVisitReasons}} of {{BlockedTaskReasonsService}} "

When an association is created for the first time, its start and end date are populated using the current and the end of shift date time respectively. If the association is inactivated (in native app, the queu checkbox is deselected) saved and then selected back again, the association start and end datetimes remain the same. This situation causes Desktop app not to show the current switcher in the list of switchers in the Manage Queue option.

*Steps to reproduce*

# Create one current shift (if none)
# Create two queues (Q1 and Q2)
# In native app, go to Switcher Execution flow and select Q1, click CONTINUE. In the database, there is a new association for Q1 whos start date matches the current date (in UTC in cloud) and end date to the shift end date
# Click BACK and deselect Q1 and select Q2 this time, hit CONTINUE. In the databse Q1 association is inactive, start datetime remains the same; end datetime is set to current timestamp.
# Click BACK again and swap the queue selection (Q1 selected, Q2 unselected) In the databse Q1 start and end date remain the same (they should be updated to current and shift end datetimes respectively)
