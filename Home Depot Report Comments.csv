PPS-4573,AYLIN YEPA,"*What was happening?*

When we open the create quote CCUI modal, we were saving the behavior of what to do after the user clicked “Select”, but, when the modal was closed, the data was still there, so….



*Why is it intermittent?*

It isn't really intermittent, the bug appears when the user creates a quote, and then returns to create a project because the data that I mentioned was already saved; However, If the user creates the project first and then goes to create a quote, the bug isn't there, because the data wasn't saved yet.



*In summary…*

Steps that lead us to the bug:

# Create a quote
# Create a project

Steps that save you from the bug:

# Create a project
# Create a quote

Leave this ticket for QC items and create a new one for No-QC once we know if exists a discount bases on quantity.

1.  Should {{isQuotable}} be set to {{false}} for this material list item given the Job site deliver issue?

2.  Does {{Job site delivery exists but it is not supported}} indicated that it should not be quoted?  If the answer is yes then it seems like we would want {{isQuatable = false}} for the material list item.

3.  If the item still should be quotable then this may be a bug in our ATQ logic, but this may be an edge case or data issue.  I’ll have somebody check to see if we are intentionally throwing an error due to requirements that we received.",2024-07-17T18:36:04.823-0400

* {{/SearchNav/model}} have a field called {{omsThdSku}} into product identifiers, that one could be null (ex. product with {{309133115}} itemId has it null), but, returning to the first point, even if {{/SearchNav/model}} endpoint says that {{omsThdSKu}} is null, {{suggested-resolutions}}endpoint give us data in {{omsId}} because it takes {{itemId}}

In summary, if we are looking for a product in {{suggested-resolutions}} with {{omsId}} null, it will be impossible; On the other hand, if we are looking for a product in {{/SearchNav/model}} with {{omsThdSku}} null, we can use the product with {{ItemId}} equals to {{309133115}}.

Here {{suggested-resolutions}}endpoint returns {{itemId}} as {{omsId}}

search commons does not have a field {{omsThdSku}}, this is part of the {{associateSkus}} field though, which is an array of strings (each a SKU), this is from their [documentation|https://thd.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/API/pages/1953989315/SearchNav+API+V2-Dictionary]:

!image-20240404-172413.png|width=409,height=75,alt=""image-20240404-172413.png""!

{{resolvedSku}} from suggested-resolutions is the field that might have this value, but the rule from where to map this value is:

# {{specialOrderSku}}
# {{storeSkuNumber}}
# the first value of {{associatedSkus}}.

And from what I understood from the graphQL, is that we get 2 fields {{omsThdSku}} and {{storeSkuNumber, where omsThdSku}} can be null, in the REST API for search commons {{associateSkus}} will always have a value, as using both fields to create the array… So I don’t think we are not able to get {{omsThdSku}}.

This will need changes on the Quote Orchestration side to ensure the LDAP is properly associated with the project list so it appears in the results from OVS (COM).",2024-01-10T09:29:40.540-0500

When the user stops typing, only results that match the current text on screen should show.  This should continue to occur as long as the user is actively in the filter input field.  If they leave the input field without selecting, the text they entered should disappear.  

Conversely, if they stop typing and select from the valid options that match below, their text input should disappear and be replaced by the option they selected.  At that point, the options in the dropdown for that filter should show all options except the one(s) they’ve already selected.

The filter component from the DesignOps team lets us input whatever filters we like.

Also we should all be using the same filter component from DesignOps.

I guess it could be a very simple spike to ask each team what they need to filter on so we know what to pass to the filter component based on the respective area (ex. Projects, Accounts, Quotes).",2024-02-09T12:07:14.560-0500

I know that we already have the implementation (on pro-assist not in harmony customer persona component) of the filters in 2/3 sub-teams (Quotes/Account Detail), I'm not sure if is already in Project Detail page (I suppose is what we need to ask Matt)

# “AND if I had a previously sorted column, the arrow for that column will be going up” so… at the beginning I’m gonna show the arrow up for “Created date” and then if an user click on “Order #” I have to keep the arrow up for “Created date” and add an arrow up for “Order #”? But this isn’t strange according with the clause of just one filter at time because is gonna seems that I’m sorting by both fields but I will only apply the latest one
# At the beggining the columns that can be sort but that had not been clicked, which icon should show? arrow up/down or even dash?
# [~accountid:62e297bc3aaeedcae75668dd] Do you already have the colors to fill the columns?

PPS-1732,AYLIN YEPA,"Hey! [~accountid:62e297bc3aaeedcae75668dd]  I'm gonna left here the questions that we had talking about by slack, just to keep the track.

* At the first half of the ticket says that when a sort be selected by three times we should return to the ""initial state"", sorting ""created at""; However, at the bottom it mention that the arrow in the column header should disappear and keep the order that was set on the second time
* I left a SS for the initial state (let me know if it is correct), supposing that yes, how the user could know that, for example, “Order #” is sorteable? Just clicking on it?  (I mean, at the beginning Isn't there any expected arrow or dash on sorteable columns)
* Talking with Victor Diaz from Design team seams that the code is not ready to fill the column when is being sorted, but if it is needed we can ask for it.

SEOIM-1321,ENRIQUE CANEDO,"Update:
Hey team, good news

After talks with product-information API team, we conclude that the error is due to this

{noformat}The reason N-5yc1vZbx4wZ10l.json is not working is because . i don't see this value in manifest.json  adding the said N value to the manifest file will fix this issue..
So basically during server startup the system loads all the n values present in the manifest json into a cache and proceeds with making the call to get the n value json file only if the value given is in the loaded cache which in our case it's not{noformat}

Basically, every time an error occurs regarding some information that should be displayed in THD site, we should first evaluate that the file where the information is being obtained exists in the manifest.json file and, if so, it exists in manifest.json file we should check if n-value file has information as such.

Currently, [+the component has a logic+|https://github.com/one-thd/ocm_pd_component_related-search/blob/master/src/components/subcomponents/PopularCategories.js#L21] where it checks if the {{storeId}} or the value passed is shorter than 4, it will add a {{0}} at the beginning to the number. This is, because in GCP they have all the files to all the stores with {{0}}  and without {{0}} . At the beginning, I thought they're doing the same like the files for Details pages or Home Services pages, which they have a file for {{storeId}} 121 with a {{0}} and without {{0}}  and they have the same content for both files. However, they're not doing the same for {{PopularCategories}} , they have files with {{0}} and without {{0}} , but they do not have the same content.

Also, if you are beyond page 1, the ratings (⭐) link should point to the first page for that product.

The problem with this logic is that component, which render the ratings (⭐) and the Questions, doesn't support this kind of logic to jump between different pages. The component it was made just to scroll through the page.  For that reason, I just leave the logic to scroll to the Customer Reviews section when the ratings(⭐) it's clicked.

Some flowers produce many blossoms for months, while others show an explosion of color once or twice per year. Keep your plant trimmed and deadheaded to get more flowers. Apart from succulents, few plants thrive in long periods of drought or temps greater than 90 degrees, so ask an associate or do some research if your garden is wilting in the summertime."",

Some plants are prone to pests, others are delicate and dry out easily, and a few plants thrive on neglect or need special soil blends.

* Cloned both experiences {{article}} and {{article-listing-page}} 
* Looked which component used each experience to render the metadata tags. The experience {{article}} uses the component [<ArticleMetadata />|https://github.com/one-thd/ocm_pd_component_metadata/blob/master/src/components/ArticleMetadata.js] and the experience {{article-listing-page}} uses [<Metadata />|https://github.com/one-thd/ocm_pd_component_metadata/blob/master/src/components/Metadata.js] component.

The {{<ArticleMetadata />}} in the {{og:type}} tag, just render the value {{type}} returned by the backend and always has the same value “how-to“:


{code:json}{
  ""canonicalURL"": ""/c/ab/types-of-car-jacks/9ba683603be9fa5395fab901ee065ff3"",
  ""description"": ""A car jack lifts your car so you can change tires and make repairs. Use this guide to learn more about the different types of car jacks available at The Home Depot."",
  ""siteName"": ""The Home Depot"",
  ""title"": ""Types of Car Jacks"",
  ""type"": ""how-to"",
  ""heading"": null,
  ""facebookAdmins"": ""100005416960152"",
  ""__typename"": ""Metadata""
}{code}


But looking at the response I saw that, also the backend returns the type of article ({{articleType}}). This value can help to determinate which type of article page is and render the correct information in the {{og:type}} tag.",2023-07-13T20:14:24.222-0400

The component [<StoreRatingsAndReviewsDesktop/>|https://github.com/one-thd/ocm_pd_component_ratings-and-reviews/blob/master/src/component/RatingsAndReviewsDesktop.js] renders the reviews in {{store-finder}}  page. Also, I found the component which renders the number of reviews which is [<PagerDisplayText/>|https://github.com/one-thd/ocm_pd_component_ratings-and-reviews/blob/master/src/component/PagerDisplayText/PagerDisplayText.js]

Looking at the component <StoreRatingsAndReviewsDesktop/>, there are two places where the component <PagerDisplayText/> is used. The component <PagerDisplayText/> can receive a prop call {{seoPageNumber}} which is used to render the number of reviews per page, but we’re not passing this prop to the component

{noformat}<PagerDisplayText
  topPager
  pageContext={pageContext}
  loading={loading}
  statistics={statistics}
  showReviewsText
  seoPageNumber
/>{noformat}

and

SEOIM-940,ZAJITH CORRO,"*Update 07/06/2023:*

Looking at the the component {{<PagerDisplayText/>,}} I found that the prop called {{seoPageNumber}} was used as a boolean value and based on that, the component select a different value to add when the page change. 

In the first section of the page, this prop was passed correctly and that's why in the {{Details}} and the {{Reviews}} page, in {{store-finder}}, the section below the search bar contains the label {{1-30}} in the first page. 

{code:js}<PagerDisplayText
  topPager
  pageContext={pageContext}
  loading={loading}
  statistics={statistics}
  showReviewsText
  seoPageNumber
/>{code}

But in the second section, below the pagination buttons, they were not passing this prop to the component

{code:js}<PagerDisplayText
  pageContext={pageContext}
  statistics={statistics}
  loading={loading}
  showReviewsText
/>{code}

SEOIM-874,ERIC FANNING,Per Luana: looking into it with the Nucleus team to find out what’s happening,2023-06-26T10:33:21.097-0400
SEOIM-874,LUANA FERNANDES,"[~accountid:557058:0d382cc4-a36f-4a87-acc5-90c5d2af0d4a] and [~accountid:557058:4875b813-3492-410a-acab-a81d861348dd] are assessing this to discuss two possibilities for the redirects happening on the /l/ page: 

# remove the state directory route and have it displayed to both bots and users on the {{/l}} route.
# remove the redirect for users on {{/l}} to {{/l/search}}.

SEOIM-874,LUANA FERNANDES,[~accountid:62b9e040268cac6e31c39de7] This is the story we need help getting updates and status.,2023-06-28T10:17:48.030-0400
SEOIM-874,NICHOLAS BROGNA,"From a technical perspective, the solution proposed by [~accountid:557058:4875b813-3492-410a-acab-a81d861348dd] would be the most straightforward and eliminates any complexity of having to manage conditional logic between bots and normal users (which could also be considered “cloaking” and is typically not advisable), but we would need guidance from the product owner to understand if this is a wanted behavior. 

Some questions:

* Do we have links on our site that point to the root level of {{/l/}}? If not, how would a bot/crawler end up on this page? If we do, whats the expectation for the content on that page?
* Would showing the store list with additional crawlable links satisfy those expectations?",2023-06-28T11:18:08.628-0400
SEOIM-874,MIKE BREITENBACH,"We need to table this for now until we can have a broader discussion with our team when a few members return from OOO. We do have a large number of links pointing to {{/l/}} and {{/l/storeDirectory}}. If we plan to remove one of the two URLs, we’ll need a strategy for redirects and link updates first. 

My understanding is that the content of the consolidated page would have the store finder map features at the top and the content from the [store directory page|https://www.homedepot.com/l/storeDirectory] below it (without a requiring a redirect to update the map content).


[~accountid:557058:4875b813-3492-410a-acab-a81d861348dd]  One question for the meantime: does removing the redirect on {{/l}} to {{/l/search}} require us to remove the {{/l/storeDirectory}} URL? Or are those two changes mutually exclusive?",2023-06-28T13:40:15.456-0400
SEOIM-874,ANTHONY OLIVER,"[~accountid:62a34e4c932059006f91eaf7] removing the redirect leaves users landing on the store directory page and I don’t think there is a way for them to get to the search.

I think the ideal solution here would be refactoring {{/l}}  to be the Store Search page (ie. /l/search/XXXX ). The link to {{/l/storedirectory}} is in the footer which should be on every page a bot would visit so it is still easily discoverable.",2023-06-28T15:11:32.416-0400
SEOIM-874,MIKE BREITENBACH,"Thanks [~accountid:557058:4875b813-3492-410a-acab-a81d861348dd] . I thought we were discussing combining the store finder and store directory content onto one page.

- The story mentions that the number of cards per row should be 2 on mobile, 4 on tablet, and 6 on desktop. Currently mobile and tablet work the same (2 cards per row) , but that matches the behavior on the THD homepage, which is what we’re looking for, so you can leave that as is. 
- This pod should sit below the content pod (which the QA page you sent doesn’t have) and above the capabilities cards. Shop by Category and the Capabilities pods should be swapped.

Yes, we are the right team to speak with if you need to alter this URL

We will have to do some research on impact. We copied this as a requirement that existed in .com when we wewrote these API.

SEOIM-499,ALEXANDRA TALSKY,"Hi Everyone, 
[~accountid:62b9e040268cac6e31c39de7] 
This ask came in right before I left for PTO. The discussion was around either using core UI thus the links would be Blue or Stencil (links are black) and if we did do Stencil then would the information have to be set up in contentful? I asked Anthony to look into the effort for a stencil/contentful type migration 
*SEE BELOW :* 
[~accountid:557058:4875b813-3492-410a-acab-a81d861348dd]  please correct me if I'm wrong here or missed something 🙂 

----

-
So w/o going over everything here..... here’s a short list of task around this type of effort:

* work with Contentful team to create content model/space for this information to live
* work with Contentful team to have this exposed thorough the content API in graphql
* dev’s need to update useDataModel call to pull from contentful api (Store-Details component)
* the element this data is displayed in would probably need a little work for styling and layout (possibly)

In my eyes, the largest lift here would be how that data gets into the Contetnful system as I assume that it is different for each store

– 

*NEXT STEPS* Decide if this needs to be migrated and if that makes sense for this page now. If it doesn't, then we should use Core UI styles for the links in the SEO block. 

Let me know if you would like to chat live on this 🙂 
Thank you!

Per Javier’s suggestion, the next configuration was also tested:
*Template Path: ‘*../packages/templates/src/templates/button/BasicButtons/’
*Named Export:* BasicButtons

Which is a true relative path, and it worked the same.

*However both configurations result in an error once the application is rebuilt and the component won’t display anymore.*

----

Tried knapsack’s suggested solution for the {{BasicButtons.js}} template and got the expected results as shown in the picture. *However the component is not showing at all.*

(This is the automatically generated code snippet)

Swiping/Dragging drawer functionality:

*1.- Using vanilla JS to create our own dragging functionality:*

How we would do it: More research might be needed on this, but we could consider using HTML5’s Drag and Drop API for our purposes or we could use native events such as “onMouseDown”, “onMouseMove” and “onMouseUp” and modify the element.

Advantages: 

* Since it’s done entirely by us, we can control what it does and it’s weight pretty easily.
* We could easily expand on this as needed.

Disadvantages:

* Could be complex and might take some time to implement.
* Features such as swiping to certain threshold and dismissing the component might require a lot more calculations.
* Think of it as “reinventing the wheel”.

Resources:

* A very basic example of how dragging could work with vanilla JS [https://javascript.info/mouse-drag-and-drop|https://javascript.info/mouse-drag-and-drop|smart-link]

*2.- Using a third party library:*

How we would do it: A combination of {{@use-gesture/react}} and {{react-spring}} is the most widely used, ""out-of-the-box"" solution there is. {{react-spring}} handles the actual animation and {{@use-gesture/react}} handles the item positioning and other such logic.

See this online example using both libraries:

[https://codesandbox.io/s/github/pmndrs/use-gesture/tree/main/demo/src/sandboxes/action-sheet|https://codesandbox.io/s/github/pmndrs/use-gesture/tree/main/demo/src/sandboxes/action-sheet|smart-link]

Another option would be using {{Framer}} an all-in-one alternative that bundles both gestures and animations in one. But also comes with a lot more with might add weight, though apparently you can choose what to import and use.
[https://www.framer.com/docs/|https://www.framer.com/docs/|smart-link]

Advantages:

* Configuration aside, might be a quick and easy solution.
* We could use both libraries to expand on the gestures and animations of our other components

Disadvantages:

* Adds a considerable amount of weight to our library.
* We might not event use all of the features provided by both libraries, creating “dead-weight”.

Resources:

* {{@use-gesture/react}} [https://www.npmjs.com/package/@use-gesture/react|https://www.npmjs.com/package/@use-gesture/react|smart-link]
* {{react-spring}}[https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-spring|https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-spring|smart-link]

Note: Tailwind provides a {{transition}} utility to handle animations, but this doesn’t provide us with the “gesture” logic needed for actual swiping/dragging features. While we could leverage the Tailwind utilites for the actual animation, we would still need to develop logic our own logic for the gesture.



h1. Modal activation and dismissal:

*1.- Using Tailwind’s* {{transition}} *property.*

How we would do it: Right now we could be leveraging Tailwind’s {{transition}} to be able to create an animation.

[https://tailwindcss.com/docs/transition-property|https://tailwindcss.com/docs/transition-property|smart-link]

An example of what can be achieved:

[https://tailwindcomponents.com/component/animation-modal|https://tailwindcomponents.com/component/animation-modal|smart-link]

Advantages:

* We wouldn’t be adding any new third party libraries to the project.

Disadvantages:

* Somewhat limited control of the animation.

*2.- Using a third party library.*

How would we do it: Using something like {{react-spring}}, for example, which is a library for building animated UI components. 

Here is an example of a modal popup created with the library:
(Scroll down in the demo view until you see the popup)
[https://codesandbox.io/s/ycouuu|https://codesandbox.io/s/ycouuu|smart-link]

Another option is {{Framer}} which is another powerful alternative to react-spring and it also supports gestures.
[https://www.framer.com/docs/|https://www.framer.com/docs/|smart-link]

Advantages:

* Relatively easy to use.
* Powerful and full control of our animations.
* If chosen could be used to empower the rest of our component animations.

Disadvantages:

* Adding a third party library will add weight to our project.
* Might require comparing a few libraries to find what is better for us.
* Some added features might go unused, thus creating “dead-weight”.

*3.- Using Tailwind’s HeadlessUI* {{Transition}} *component.*

How we would do it: *HeadlessUI* is a third party library (also by Tailwind) that provides with unstyled, fully accesible components. One of such components is {{Transition}} which is a wrapper component that can be provided with a “starting point” and an “end point” to control the flow of the content inside it. Wrapping our component with {{Transition}} could allow us to customize the animation fully.

[https://headlessui.com/react/transition|https://headlessui.com/react/transition|smart-link]

Advantages:

* Integrates with Tailwind’s utility classes quite well.
* Improved control over the animation flow.
* Relatively smaller weight when compared to animation libraries.

Disadvantages:

* Adding a third party library is in itself a disadvantage, because we always add extra weight to ours.
* We’d be using only the {{Transition}} component, so the rest of the library would be completely useless for us.",2022-12-21T18:24:17.767-0500

* In order to include more than one color in certain icons, it is possible to predefine one static color for every single one of these elements composing our icons. These elements with static color will not be modified regardless of what color is used for the icon as a whole afterwards.
* To specify these static colors in each element it is necessary to use our utility classes as shown next:

Note that one portion of the SVG, the {color:#36b37e}<circle>{color}, has a “className” attribute and it contains the utility class assigning a static color.

If we think it’s still needed, then may need to sync to make sure I understand the conflation of language with “mode” and “theme” here to edit.
# *Review and update the demo shown in “Toggle Color Mode”:* Think we should remove the icons. They sort of indicate “Pro” is equal to “dark mode.” Believe [~accountid:70121:aa5703b9-0eef-44cb-aa3e-20fbe012e854] confirmed that this wasn’t technically true overall--Pro will in theory be more a “brand” theme that has both light and dark mode options.

BENAB-2052,JESUS TALAVERA,"Did research on the behavior and have two takeaways:

h2. *We No Longer Need the Polyfill:*

Safari has seen about three major version releases since we added the focus-visible polyfill, and in that meantime official support for the pseudo-class has been added; so we might no longer need the polyfill. I did some testing, and it looks like we can remove it safely.

h2. *A Safari “Bug”:*

The weird focus behavior on Safari/IOS is being caused due to us (in our code) programmatically setting focus on elements when they’re first rendered. This focus action is usually judged by the browser, who determines if the focus styling should be visible or not; in this case, Safari thinks it should (while other browsers do not).

According to [usual conventions|https://drafts.csswg.org/selectors-4/#the-focus-visible-pseudo], mouse navigation (including user taps on mobile) *should not* result in a newly shown element gaining visible focus, but browsers might choose to do so anyway (in this case Safari) and there is nothing we can do to stop it until the creation of an API to control it (*Update:* the experimental API is out now, but probably not supported/functional yet in Safari).

So in order to fix it, we can try:

* Doing what [tailwindlabs|https://github.com/tailwindlabs/headlessui/pull/2347][ |https://github.com/tailwindlabs/headlessui/pull/2347][did for their headless components|https://github.com/tailwindlabs/headlessui/pull/2347].
* *(Update:* this is a recently added, experimental API that might not work in Safari *)* Manually going through all of our functions using focus() and differentiate a mouse triggered focus from a keyboard triggered focus, and add {{focusVisible=false}} to them ([reference here|https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/:focus-visible]).

Looks like a rather high LOE, so have to be sure we really want to fix this. This is more on Safari than it is on us to solve, but we can create a workaround.

Also: An [interesting blog post|https://blogs.igalia.com/mrego/2022/04/08/focus-visible-is-shipping-in-safari-webkit/] regarding focus-visible and its shortcomings in Safari by an Igalia team member themselves.

BENAB-1639,J SWIRSKY,Note to [~accountid:61a7d8083618cd006ff0e33a]: for future in the backlog: shadow tokens for all edges (not just dropshawdow to the bottom),2024-04-19T10:27:45.836-0400
BENAB-1639,JESUS TALAVERA,"h3. Proposal 1: Use a CSS Trick to hide/show the shadow on scroll

Basically, have the shadow always present on the header (via a prop?) but have it initially covered by a small white “slit” div element. On scroll, the div will stick to the same position of the shadow, uncovering it.

* {{DrawerHeader}} will have the shadow built-in (enabled through a prop?)
* {{DrawerHeader }}will have -an sticky- an absolutely positioned ""cover"" element.
* {{DrawerHeader}} doesn't have a sticky variant, it needs one for this to work.
* {{DrawerBody}} will need to stop overflowing into itself (possibly through a prop?)
* {{Drawer}} needs to be positioned to allow absolute elements to have dimensions within it. A “relative” position will do, since it’s for our purposes not different than “static”.

*Pros:*

* Low-code, almost CSS-only solution for the drop shadow. 
* Easy to implement.
* Can be enabled through props.
* Little changes to default behavior.
* Also enables “true” sticky behavior on the drawer, which is something that has been asked.

*Cons:*

* -Header will increase in padding size slightly (Roughly equal to the size of the shadow, so it can be covered)- Found a workaround!
* Very subtle illusion that the shadow is moving upwards for a bit while the cover element moves upwards.
* An additional small, floating, absolutely positioned div that has to be managed by the DrawerHeader. Luckily for us, this will be rather easy to do.",2024-04-22T19:11:34.038-0400
BENAB-1639,JESUS TALAVERA,"h3. Proposal 2: Provide consumers with the tools to do it themselves

We have an internal hook called {{useScrollTrigger}} that is only being currently used to close Dropdown on page scroll, and this hook could be improved and made public so that it takes in a threshold value to detect scroll past a certain point and expose a shadow boolean prop on the {{DrawerHeader}} so that consumers can make it true or false based on the current container scroll.

* {{useScrollTrigger}} needs to be made public and improved to accept a threshold option and the ability to change the current target from window to a container.
* {{DrawerHeader}} needs a boolean shadow prop that indicates when to render the drop shadow.
* One of our templates needs to be modified to show the consumer how to achieve this result.

*Pros:*

* If the {{useScrollTrigger}} is made available it can be used for a variety of other situations that involve scroll detection.
* Consumers will get a higher degree of customization on when to render the drop shadow.

*Cons:*

* Potentially high LOE to figure out how to improve the {{useScrollTrigger}} hook. Need to add additional logic.
* Despite the fact that this small effect is rather tricky to implement, from an outside consumer perspective might make them think twice before adding it due to the requirement of extra work on their part.
* Adds an additional event listener.",2024-04-23T14:50:27.420-0400
BENAB-1639,JESUS TALAVERA,"h3. Proposal 3: Create a Shadow prop, leave the rest to the consumers

Not too different from proposal 2, other than the fact that we’re not providing a hook for them to detect scrolling. Basically just enable shadow through a boolean prop, but do not provide consumers with the tools to enable it; just allow them to figure out and tweak their own code.

*Pros:*

* Small effort on our part.
* We have delivered a shadow prop. It’s up to the consumers to figure out what’s the best approach for their current situation.

*Cons:*

* Won’t always follow guidelines. With no standard, we’ll see wildly different implementations with different metrics.
* Will require greater deal of effort on consumer’s side to figure out the logic to show/hide the shadow when overflown content goes beneath it.",2024-04-23T14:54:25.278-0400

BENAB-1307,JESUS TALAVERA,"h3. Update 04/05/2024:

A number of insights have been obtained throughout discovery:

* Knapsack is currently using something very similar to [style-dictionary|https://amzn.github.io/style-dictionary/#/], by the name of [Knapsack’s Token Engine|https://docs.knapsack.cloud/site/ks-docs/latest/pages/token-engine-configuration]. It has similar functionalities, but lacks a few features we have come to expect from the former, such as the capacity to separate tokens between any number of files for a cleaner authoring experience.
* Knapsack’s Token Engine is currently able to reference other values, so that they’re linked; however it is currently not possible to reference values that are also referencing other values.
* We could potentially make layer one (primitive/base tokens) and layer two (middle tokens) part of our token {{.json}} file while having layer three (semantic tokens) living inside our tailwind preset. This is however, not the preferred choice.

More needs to be discussed/researched to arrive at a final decision. We are also scheduling meetings with the Knapsack team to discuss possible additions to the Token Engine.",2024-04-05T12:42:27.824-0400
BENAB-1307,JESUS TALAVERA,"h3. Update 04/08/2024:

After briefly talking with Knapsack, it turns out the “references that point to references” issue was a bug, and thus currently supported. Haven’t been able to reliably reproduce the issue thus far, but looks like it is only happening on initial setup and not often, so at most it only means a small implementation delay.

*Proposal going forward:*

We currently have the necessary structure to support this color scale rework. On our {{knapsack.design-tokens.json}} file we could create the following pattern for all tokens *(naming conventions not final yet)*:

{noformat}{
  ""base-tokens"": {
    ""white"": {
      ""$value"": ""#FFFFFF"",
      ""$type"": ""color""
    }
  },
  ""reference-tokens"": {
    ""background-primary"": ""{base-tokens.white}""
  },
  ""semantic-tokens"": {
    ""accordion-background"": ""{reference-tokens.background-primary}""
  }
}{noformat}

This way, any changes done to base tokens or reference tokens will reflect on the semantic ones.

*Note:* We requested Knapsack to add the feature of being able to separate these tokens across different files which can also reference each other. If this feature gets implemented on time, we could also separate the three types of tokens; base, reference and semantic on their own files for cleaner authoring.",2024-04-08T10:58:16.413-0400

Dumping these here if future reference is needed:

All of the files follow our own composable approach (ie. Calendar is composed of a CalendarGrid which formats the Day components in the desired way). Files are relatively simple; no more than one exported component per file, but since they’re typescript, export some types as well.

*Calendar:* Is composed of a div as the root element, a <CalendarWeekDays /> componente, a <CalendarGrid /> component and a few other native html elements styled to create the desired view.

* The calendar component is the common piece between the Single DatePicker and Range Datepicker. 
* The <CalendarGrid /> is provided an amount of <Day /> components equal to a value obtained from day.js methods.
* The <CalendarWeekDays /> component is there to render days of the week. Can be hidden.
* “Today” (current date) is always marked on the calendar with a special style and remains unchanged even if user selects some other date.
* Accepts a few prop options such as: date, for the actual date; onDayClick, a callback to execute on selecting a date; hideWeekDays, a boolean; showMonth, boolean to hide or show the current month UI; type, which decides if the calendar is either single date or range date.



*CalendarWeekDays:* Composed of a div as the root element, renders a number of spans containing the days of the week. No interactivity, and only takes in the typography props.



*CalendarGrid:* Composed of a diverse as the root element, provides grid formatting to the elements contained 

within, specifically <Day /> components.



*Day:* A button using styles to define a “selected” and “unselected” state. The button is also using aria properties to define accesibility on both states. It contains a day.js formatted label for screen readers with the full year as well as the simple day number for normal viewing.



*DatePicker:* The most complex component, ties together the multiple composable components and handles some logic between them.

* Composed of the following components: <Calendar />, <DateInput />, <MonthSlider />, <Divider /> and <Button />
* Despite the name “MonthSlider”, the component is actually the month paginator.
* Uses the <Popover /> component and places the <Calendar /> inside it.
* The <DateInput /> actually doesn’t enforce any masking; user can write things other than dates. It however, has some internal logic (useDatePicker hook) that detects multiple date formats and passes it to the <Calendar />.
* The <Calendar /> appears whenever the <DateField /> receives any sort of interaction; including clicking on it and focus. It doesn’t wait for the user to click on the calendar icon (which is, in fact, just an <Icon /> and has no interactions).
* Has a ghost button at the bottom, after a <Divider /> component that says “Today”. Clicking on it takes the user to the “today” date.





*DateRangePicker:* A range selection variant of the DatePicker which uses a few different components, mainly range one range variant of <DateInput /> and a new <DateRangeSidePanel />. The rest remain the same.

* Composed of the following components: <Calendar /> (with type=“range”, <DateRangeInput />, <MonthSlider />, <Divider />, <Button /> and <DateRangeSidePanel />.
* Similar in functionality to the single DatePicker, excepting the logic that handles range selections. Uses the useDateRangePicker hook for range selection logic.
* Uses the <Popover /> component and expands it by targeting the div and overriding the max width style.
* Uses a <DateRangeSidePanel /> component that displays a number of predefined date shortcuts.



There are modal options for both types of datepicker available (single and range), which are basically the same, just structured as a modal.



Accesibility is weird and/or absent in some places. It definitely does not have any keyboard accesibility.

No month selection UI.",2023-12-20T14:52:07.902-0500
BENAB-1184,JESUS TALAVERA,"h1. {color:#4c9aff}Other Insights:{color}

* In the Enterprise repo there are many publicly exported components, these are: {{<DatePicker />}} ,{{<DateRangePicker />}}, {{<Calendar />}}, {{<CalendarGrid />}} among others.
* All of these components follow our composability patterns, and can be reused from the simplest to the most complex.
* Coded in typescript; some files also export types and not just the component.
* Keyboard accessibility is not present; there are only some aria properties implemented.
* Uses [Day.js|https://day.js.org/] as a dependency for date formatting and parsing. They use this to be able to receive dates in a wide number of formats in their {{<DateInputs />}} and still be able to ascertain a date.
* For their {{<DateInput />}} subcomponents (which are being used in {{<DatePicker />}}) they’re creating their own {{<InputBase />}} component.",2023-12-20T14:54:45.648-0500

* Uses an ES format that allows us to choose only a select group of modules instead of importing the whole library. (Meaning bundle sizes will be small and we won’t be pulling in stuff we won’t use)

*Cons:*

* Optimized for vanilla JS; there might be a few caveats when using with React.
* Initializing the date picker requires us to hook into the component’s lifecycle; might want to watch out for any curve balls that could come from this.

[https://react-spectrum.adobe.com/react-aria/useDatePicker.html|https://react-spectrum.adobe.com/react-aria/useDatePicker.html|smart-link] 

*Pros:*

* High amount of features and customization.
* Prop getters to enhance a variety of date picker-related elements: label, groupings, fields, buttons, and forms/validation.
* Handles it’s own state.
* Accesible out-of-the-box.
* Great documentation, demonstrating all of the functionality. Examples using TailwindCSS.
* We can install only the packages we want. The datepicker hook would be 600 kb.

*Cons:*

* Anatomy follows a consistent pattern; meaning less flexibility for custom triggers.
* The TailwindCSS example seems to be broken at the moment.
* We’d need to install two different hooks for both single date picker and range pickers.
* Documented examples mix in a bunch of other React-Aria hooks. Unclear if we’re gonna need them as well.
* Fresh out of beta.
* About 4 to 6 dependencies that implement accessibility, localization and other features. We might be able to make do without them though.
* No timeRangepicker functionality.

h2. *Rehookify/datepicker:*

[https://github.com/rehookify/datepicker|https://github.com/rehookify/datepicker|smart-link] 

*Pros:*

* The smallest bundle size out of all options.
* Can choose between a context version or a hook version of the datepicker tool.
* The most customizable one, give that it has basically zero dependencies.
* Exhaustive, all-in-one place docs.
* It’s a hook, we fully control what we render and how we do it.
* Has its own state, but exposes it so that we can work with it.

*Cons:*

* We will have to implement the accessibility and localization by ourselves.
* Small community around it, but it still seems to be regularly maintained.
* Floating behavior is on us as well.

h2. *headless-datepicker:*

* Some built-in accesibility.
* Handles its own state.
* Customizable through pre-defined config objects.
* A component composed of slots which we can fully customize and style ourselves. Examples are using TailwindCSS.

BENAB-1104,JESUS TALAVERA,"h3. *Update 04/10/2024:*

While it is possible to pass custom content within the {{MenuItem}} component, it doesn’t seem suited for the checkbox use-case.

Two issues: 

# Custom content will increase the size of the menu items.
# A {{MenuItem}} is a button, so it doesn’t make sense to have nested interactivity in there.

It is possible to create such an implementation through the use of controlled checkboxes, but that still leaves the issue of the apparent double interactivity:

* Dropdown/Menu will have to remain open as long as users are still selecting options.
* How does a user de-select an option? By opening the Menu and clicking on the same item again?
* If the component is being controlled, it will receive an array and also return an array.

Browser: All

Device: Desktop/Mobile

Bug description: ​The “User Activated” progress bar template is using a “trailingLabel” prop which has no effect on the component and is not called out anywhere. Did we mean to use “endLabel”?

Steps to recreate:​ In Knapsack - Progress Bar, go to the “User Activated Progress Bar” and expand the code to see it.

h2. Test Improvements:

* There’s a repeat of the “should show status messages test”. We should remove it.
* Missing a test for the{{disableStatusIcon}} prop.
* (Suggestion) We could create a test for {{labelPlacement}} to make sure the label is still present, no matter the option.
* (Suggestion) We usually don’t test for utility classes, but the {{value}} prop affects a sphere of actual functionality and probably should be tested.",2023-08-30T15:46:21.416-0400
BENAB-931,JESUS TALAVERA,"*Important:* Knapsack has confirmed that migrating to v4 requires node v16, which completely blocks migration. This unfortunately also blocks testing out the migration. Calling this out because this will most likely require some internal discussion and possibly be brought up to knapsack when we meet with them.

*Update (7/13/2023):* Some discussion was carried out, and the consensus is that we would probably benefit from bumping from v14 to v18. We would still want to ask knapsack about the node >=16 requirement and why is it needed.

These are some of the questions we could be asking knapsack in regards to v4:


* What does the “design token engine revamp” mean exactly? Will our tokens change format? Will they be automatically updated?
* (Bug, sometimes the UI in knapsack jumps around when you start making changes to content blocks) Does the new version of knapsack make some UI improvements in regards to the “jumpiness” while editing present on v3?

The problem seems to stem from the fact that the footer is growing along with the rest of the table’s overflow content, which provokes the scrolling behavior.

h3. Features:

The Codespaces are online dev environments that can be initialized from existing repositories on github, as long as a user has read access to it. 

The characteristics of Codespaces vs traditional sandbox environments are:

* Codespaces are literally aimed towards online collaboration, meant for users to code without the need to download the project locally on their machine.
* They need to be run and served before users can access the application, so there are a few steps before users can see anything. This might make them not as “seamless” or accesible as other sandbox options, at least at the start.
* How many codespaces can be open at any given time is at the user level and once running have a default timeout of 6 minutes. This timeout can be configured up to a maximum of 4 hours.
* Codespaces are enabled at an organizational level and billed by hour of usage.

Some potential problems to fix/figure out:

* Running Harmony on Codespaces will probably require extra setup.
* No obvious way to serve specific templates one at a time.",2023-11-16T12:55:21.704-0500

So far, the modified URL works great, and we can get dynamic code snippets in this method. 

It only has two drawbacks:

* The code snippet shows the “usage” tab by default on start and this hides the HTML one. Knapsack team mentioned they will be tweaking some stuff so this might be one of these.
* We might also need to create one for every single one of our code templates. This is fine, i’m just wondering if there might be a way to automate it somehow.

*Note (Blocker?):* The URL works fine, but I’m seeing no way to include an external URL as component embed yet in the platform. Will bring this to the team first and see if someone knows, otherwise i’ll reach out to knapsack.

There’s also an error that pops up when opening the URL, however the snippet seems to be working fine in spite of this. Until I find a way to actually use these URLs as code embeds i’ll be able to know if this affects the template somehow.

The exception is due to duplicate calls to the *POST api/yard/audits/details* endpoint with the same payload. The endpoint is called from hdy-device when confirming or skipping an audit location during the yard audit process. We can see the logs of two calls each time this exception is thrown but as device and yard-core are able to create de audit details without error most of the times it is most likely an internet outage on tablets during the location confirmation.

!image-20230713-131531.png|width=1251,height=492!

Test case 1: UP and HDY systems working with full capabilities sending batch jobs of trailers

DIGEST is sent, received and stored in R2R BQ database:

!image-20230713-132718.png|width=2091,height=469!

CONSUMER_ACK message being sent by HDY

Successfully processed

!image-20230713-133014.png|width=2113,height=482!

After the verification is made (in the 60 min time window) there is a successful match:

!image-20230713-133548.png|width=2079,height=431!

!image-20230713-133631.png|width=2492,height=751!



The same goes for the MOVE_UPDATE messages:

HDY DIGESTs are getting through

!image-20230713-133746.png|width=2103,height=453!

UP CONSTUMER_ACK message received

!image-20230713-135248.png|width=2105,height=558!



Scenario 2

Part 1: HDY R2R controls disabled, UP sends messages

UP DIGEST messages were successfully inserted in R2R BQ, since HDY R2R controls were not enabled, no acknowledgment message was sent hence, when the verification ran a gap notification was sent to the Slack channel:

!image-20230713-140304.png|width=874,height=133!

Part 2:  HDY R2R contols re enabled, and UP R2R controls to acknowledge HDY MOVE_UPDATE messages disabled

When a batch is sent to HDY and processed, HDY sends the MOVE_UPDATE DIGEST messages, UP is unable to acknowledge the messages, when the verification runs all messages are notified to be missed in UP

POMPT-2073,EDGAR RINCON,"The main error is because there are records in the EXTNL_ORD_TRNSM_STAT table that have not been purged when the 591 sequence was purged, and they were manually purged.

When the sequence generator reaches 97000, POMPurge is called to purge the next sequence, it was observed that the endpoint is called, but two minutes later, the endpoint is called once again, this seems like a timeout that retries to call the service, I couldn’t replicate the issue.

But I replicated the application and called the endpoint two times, and the second purge process started until the first one ended, this means that this is not causing the failure to delete records in EXTNL_ORD_TRNSM_STAT.

It was discovered that this is because there are some orphan rows on this and other tables, the records in EXTNL_ORD don’t exist and due to the logic of the delete queries, these rows are not purged.

It was decided to change the queries to delete the information in the tables for not open POs, this query change allows the deletion of the orphan records also.

POMPT-1797,EDGAR RINCON,"Moses and I have done research on the 500 responses of the PUT /purchaseOrder endpoint in POMExternalOrderIntegration:

We have seen that the receipts team sends multiple requests to that endpoint simultaneously for the same PO, sometimes with different SKU and sometimes with the same, but different totalReceivedQuantity.

The problem is that the PO is updated with the first request, but when the other requests try to update the same PO, the error is returned.

In the PurchaseOrderData application, there’s this logic: 

!image-20231113-204954.png|width=100%!

Selva proposed to the receipts team to delay the calls that receipts make to our service, to consolidate a single payload per PO, and thus avoid sending so many requests to the update service and prevent race conditions from being generated.



The receipts team said they would consider it, as it would be a change to the design they have in place.

After adding the new sku to the order, this payload is sent to POValidator, as you can see, the new sku does not contain unitCostAmount (for what I required the Nirbhay endpoint), and that is why these errors are shown:

POMPT-1131,EDGAR RINCON,"But I noticed that in the enhancePO method in the POValidateManager class the sku cost is obtained only when the orderHeaderVersionNumber field is 1 or less, and being an update, the header version is 2, therefore the cost is not obtained, if a change is made here, it seems to me that the Nirbhay endpoint could be avoided, because calling the validate method the necessary data is obtained as vendorPartNumber, among others

PPS-2688,SANDY LAM,[~accountid:712020:e2a2581d-88a5-402b-8366-2dd466226762] I’m fine to leave this bug as a known issue for 1H. Leaving sprint unassigned ,2024-02-05T09:47:19.526-0500

PPS-2688,HECTOR SEGURA,"[~accountid:557058:805b846f-1f24-4e05-8182-6bf8be07c87f] Yesterday I checked the cause of the problem. I found this:

# At the moment of creation of the list, we are only sending the name of the list, we don’t send the accountId.
# The endpoint called to populate the archive list filters by accountId: *v1/material-list/deleted-lists?accountId=XXXXX,* for that reason the endpoint is returning the 4040 code.
# Also I found that the accountId saved has this format: *""accountId"": ""052305382BD6A5BB0S""*, but at the moment of calling the endpoint to populate the archived lists the accountId has this format: *accountId=ORDERUP001.* This is the request:

 [*https://proselling-np.homedepot.com/api/materialLists/v1/material-list/deleted-lists?accountId=ORDERUP001*|https://proselling-np.homedepot.com/api/materialLists/v1/material-list/deleted-lists?accountId=ORDERUP001]

So, I identify 2 points that I need work on:

# Save the accountId at the moment of the creation of the list.
# At the moment of calling the endpoint to populate the archived lists send the accountId with this format: *052305382BD6A5BB0S*",2024-02-09T11:34:07.343-0500

The *v1/material-list/deleted-lists* endpoint should filter by the *created_by* column instead of *account_id*. In that way we will be able to return all the deleted lists created by the owner.

Lets fix this by making the accountId optional.
If we have accountId then internally call materialListService.findDeletedListsByAccount(accountId)
If accountId is blank then call materialListService.findDeletedListsByCreator and use the logged in user for that.

PPS-2637,HECTOR SEGURA,"Hi [~accountid:60253f596c581700707d3ddd] I have a question about this story. Let’s say that we have a group with 4 items, [this story|https://thd.atlassian.net/browse/PPS-2635] will add a checkbox on any group of the list, but what happened if instead of checking the checkbox, the user selects all the 4 items manually, the behavior is similar as if they have checked all the group?, in this case, should we remove the 4 items and the group as well?  

If we delete the group and the items, it implies to call only once the *delete group* endpoint, it deletes the group and all the items in it. On the other hand if we delete only the items, it implies to call n times the *delete item* endpoint. I think it would be better to delete the group and items.  ",2024-03-11T15:32:12.346-0400

Following that logic and applying it to your example below, then it should remove all 4 items + the group.

e.g.
When I try to create an appointment in some store different than mine (9100), I select a project then date and time, but the FE logic tries to find an associate with last name of: “SMP001“, then, it looks in the associates of the store, but as there no associates with last name: “SMP001”, then it defaults to empty string:


The solution may be to save the associateId in store, or send to us by the BE within a request, but need Raj’s comments

SWB-1843,JORGE VELAZQUEZ,"The [modal is finished|https://thd.atlassian.net/browse/SWB-1868], but I need some clarifications on the endpoints
- -Which endpoint is going to send me the departments and the prep times?-
- Which endpoint is going to receive the data of the new associate? And which data is expecting from FE?
- There are some issues between [CommonsPMAssociate|https://github.com/one-thd/Pipeline_Commons_GG/blob/develop/src/main/java/com/homedepot/ips/gcp/model/pm/CommonsPMAssociate.java], and some mock data sent to us
- -Will the BE send the current buffer times for an associate and their departments?-

Thanks

[https://thd.atlassian.net/browse/PRO28-385|https://thd.atlassian.net/browse/PRO28-385|smart-link] 

*Observations:*
1. The preferred store field is expected to accept a minimum of three characters based on the acceptance criteria. Despite this, LLC allows for the input of just two characters. 
2. As per the acceptance criteria for the preferred store field, only integers are to be accepted. However, LLC permits the input of both integers and alphanumeric characters. 
3. According to the acceptance criteria, the preferred store must show a leading zero when a three-digit store number is entered. However, in LLC, the leading zero is not displayed, and only the three digits are shown.


The above mentioned observations can be referred to through the attached screenshots.

PROACI-520,LUIS MARTINEZ,"Deduced facts about the failed order:

We know that the customer has a Tier 0 in the enrollment for electrical products.

!image-20240730-202957.png|width=762,height=684,alt=""image-20240730-202957.png""!

We would like to know if the promotion is only applicable for tier 1 and up:

!image-20240730-203157.png|width=763,height=685,alt=""image-20240730-203157.png""!

We can check this assumption by sending a request with a tier 0 for electrical items. If we do that, we don’t get any discounts:

!image-20240730-203522.png|width=758,height=685,alt=""image-20240730-203522.png""!

If we send a request with a tier 1 for electrical items, we get a discount:

!image-20240730-203734.png|width=762,height=684,alt=""image-20240730-203734.png""!",2024-07-30T16:38:17.017-0400
PROACI-520,LUIS MARTINEZ,"*Hypothesis* about the failed order:

The total discount amount if we send a tier 1 for electrical products is 3 dollars per 5 items:

!image-20240730-203920.png|width=759,height=685,alt=""image-20240730-203920.png""!

The discount per item is 0.60:

!image-20240730-204106.png|width=764,height=687,alt=""image-20240730-204106.png""!

So, if we take the retail price that every other system has (API’s, punchout, order up) minus the unit price discount, we get the unit price sent by supplier solutions in the cxml:  

{{11.98-0.60 = 11.38}}

Thus, It appears to be that Supplier solutions is sending a tier 1 when requesting electrical items discounts for this customer: {{03004D05B8EF71F49S}} when in truth the customer has a tier 0",2024-07-30T16:46:56.378-0400

PROACI-225,AMANDA JUREK,"[~accountid:712020:0f2b9a8a-f95b-4e08-b2f0-921c4f733b95] Thank you for putting these details together! While this information listed is helpful I’d like to see the following:



* One confluence page with 2 sections:
** Section 1: PeC 1.0 support plan
** Section 2: PeC 2.0 support plan
* Information to be outlined in Section 1: Pec 1.0 support plan
** What technical support does PeC 1.0 have today? If this is just listing the contacts of our team (ex. Shad, you, and Carlos) that works 
** The PeC 1.0 section will probably be pretty short since we have a small team to keep the lights on until we retire 1 and replace it with 2
* Information to be outlined in Section 2: PeC 2.0 Support Plan 
** State that PeC 2.0 is currently under construction - Phase 0 - 3 currently being developed
** I am imagining that there will be different parts to this support plan like:
*** Outlining communication channels where PeC 2.0 support requests are to be submitted
*** What are our response times for those requests and who on the team will respond
*** Where will we track those requests
*** Defining what is a bug vs something that requires a feature enhancement



To outline the above items I would suggest reviewing what might exist today via Home Depot tech support that we can re-use (can visit [workbench.homedepot.com|http://workbench.homedepot.com] ) and you should check with [~accountid:60cd0e775c64b10071301ec8] , or TCS to see what level of support they might initially provide as part of their SOW.",2024-02-29T08:34:08.774-0500

O1-8034,NOE CAMPOS,"Hey [~accountid:606bebba4532c900696260c2], already validated my changes with Nick and also had the opportunity to catch an alert and take screenshots on the Axen App, BQ Tables and email. 

A DAG task named {{get_list_of_emails}} execute the {{CHECK_FINAL_TABLE.sql}} which retrieves from {{NM_STG4}} table and a couple more and retrieves the SKU’s that meet the threshold conditionals. Those SKU’s are then appended into a table named {{NEGATIVE_MARGIN_ANOMALY.EMAIL}}, which is later used to set a flag column named {{send_email}} on the {{MASTER_ARCHIVE.sql}}table. And the Axen App only shows those rows where the {{send_email}}column is set to {{Yes}}.

Regarding the {{NM_ALERTS}} table, Nick explained me that the table is for a view so the alerts can be seen easily but right now the table is overwritten each time the DAG runs, that’s why we are able to see the Alerts on Axen even if the table is empty. But that we should probably deprecate it and move the view query the {{MASTER_ARCHIVE}}table.

In summary, as long as the {{CHECK_FINAL_TABLE.sql}} has the proper filters, the next steps should work as they have been working.

The hyphen and spaces bug is solved on a the PR [https://github.com/one-thd/axen-dags/pull/458|https://github.com/one-thd/axen-dags/pull/458|smart-link] .

I’ll attach some screenshots of a SKU on the different tables, email and Axen app.

The bugfix was deployed on Friday, and since then, the email alerts have been reflecting the final logic. Based on this and the explanation/tests provided in the previous comment, it appears to me that the changes have successfully passed the E2E process and are ready for the next deployment to production.

O1-8034,PAARTH MAAN,"Thanks [~accountid:712020:52ca94c6-8405-41dc-9833-141c81da8411] based on documented proof presented, I think we should be good to mark E2E as done. 

To elaborate- The logic implemented is to check for department not equal to D24 and threshold -25k *or* department equal to D24 and threshold -5k. Consider we are receiving alerts for the first half of the logic would mean the changes are working. 

Ideally I would have liked to test for an item for D24 cross -5k threshold however we checked the master_archive table and it does not have any SKUs for D24 that crossed the -5k threshold. The closest a SKU came to -5k threshold was august 8th with a value of -1.3k. Consider this history, it is unlike to see a SKU cross threshold as we try to test the story. 

[~accountid:6296750a9582b8006fc4ea64] would you be comfortable with this approach and explanation to mark E2E as done?",2024-08-27T10:11:38.248-0400

During testing I observed that the table disappears when the IDM, MFG, Vendor filters are selected at the class and subclass level. Can you please look into it. 

Steps to recreate:

# Go to KPI comparison. Select IDM/MFG/Vendor filter.
# Change aggregation to Class/Subclass
# Observe the table disappear

Here are a few snips of the issue:

You can notice below that the table is present at department level aggregation

However, as soon as I select a class/subclass dropdown to aggregate differently- the tables is not available anymore (snip below)

I believe this is due to the API returning an error output when being hit for the mentioned scenarios (snip below)

O1-7203,NOE CAMPOS,"*Issue Description:*

The error occurred due to a version mismatch between {{xmlsec}} and {{lxml}}, stemming from {{xmlsec}} new release two days ago. Our Docker images fetched the latest version, leading to a mismatch error between the packages. Both are dependencies of {{python-saml}}, relying on the system package named {{libxml}} (both python packages require consistent builds with the same version of {{libxml}}). The error arose because the {{xmlsec}} team hadn't released an installation wheel for Linux (pre-compiled and specific binaries for a faster installation process), where both {{lxml}} and {{xmlsec}} were properly pre-compiled.

*Solution:*

To address this, we've implemented a workaround by specifying exact versions for both packages ({{lxml==4.9.3 xmlsec==1.3.13}}) and avoiding the use of pre-compiled binaries. Instead, we're installing them from source to ensure compatibility with the {{libxml}} system package on our Linux container, thus preventing further mismatch errors.

Added line in Dockerfile:

{noformat}RUN python3.10 -m pip install lxml==4.9.3 xmlsec==1.3.13 --no-binary=lxml --no-binary=xmlsec{noformat}

We opted for the second-to-last version of {{xmlsec}}, as using the latest version still resulted in errors. Due to time constraints, we chose the version known to work reliably and leave the update for a future opportunity.

*References:*

Workaround proposed on GitHub Issue: [https://github.com/xmlsec/python-xmlsec/issues/316|https://github.com/xmlsec/python-xmlsec/issues/316|smart-link] 

*Reflections:*

I think this issue resembles what we encountered in January but with {{xmlsec}} instead of {{lxml}}. Ensuring specific versions are defined in appears to be the way to go. Additionally, considering Nick's suggestion from the previous incident, it may be beneficial to set all requirements to specific versions and maintain scheduled reviews for optimization or security updates.
Avoiding using the pre-compiled binaries for this packages may be discarded once we have a scheduled process to review updates on our dependencies. But at the moment, it seems like a worthwhile trade-off to prevent similar issues even if it takes slightly more time building the Docker image.

From what I understand vPlan should only be applicable to Net Sales, if this is about setting up other instances of that then that's ok.

We could possibly add a validation at the end of each DAG task and get it to re-run if it does not see that the output correctly appended to the table. (I think this would be the ideal choice)

Or, we could reduce the max number of parallel tasks so that 10 tasks are not all trying to write at once.

# Move imported custom modules under the DAG context manager to avoid having to load them while the Airflow Scheduller parse the DAG.
# Move imported custom modules under functions if they are used only on that function.
# Tested the files are properly parsed by the Airflow Scheduler and manually executed them.

O1-5448,NOE CAMPOS,"I reviewed the MASTER_ARCHIVE.sql code and I found that when creating the CTE named {{PACMAN}}, the column {{SKU_NBR}} is casted as string and renamed to {{INTERNET_SKU_NBR}}, which then is used to join via the column {{INTERNET_SKU_NBR}} of the {{NEGATIVE_MARGIN_ANOMALY.NM_STG4}} table (alias NM).

But when checked on the table {{NM_STG4}}, the columns {{SKU_NBR}} and {{INTERNET_SKU_NBR}} are two different columns with different values, so, when joined, it results on NULLs on all the columns from the PACMAN CTE. ({{EFF_COST_BEGIN_DATE}}, {{EFF_COST_END_DATE}}, {{INTERNET_SKU_NBR}}, {{PERM_COST}}, {{PERM_COST_BEGIN_DATE}}, {{PERM_COST_END_DATE}}, {{PERM_RETAIL}}, {{PERM_RETAIL_BEGIN_DATE}}, {{PERM_RETAIL_END_DATE}}).

Also, I saw that the PACMAN CTE contains multiple rows associated with the same SKU_NBRs, but it changes the dates on the columns: {{PERM_RETAIL_END_DATE}}, {{PERM_COST_BEGIN_DATE}}, {{PERM_COST_END_DATE.}}  I am not sure if this is expected.",2024-01-02T22:27:55.957-0500

O1-4352,NOE CAMPOS,I finished going over and debugging the test query and sql that generates the AXEN.AXEN_MK_TOP_SKUS table. I am still not sure why the discrepancies but have some ideas. Also I ended with a list of questions (about AXEN and NURO data) that will try to answer reading the documentation and reaching to the team since they will improve my understanding of the data and help me find the cause of the discrepancies faster,2023-12-13T08:43:35.587-0500
O1-4352,NOE CAMPOS,"After running some tests on the Orders and Sales tables individually, it seems the original Test Query is a bit off. When the Axen table data is grouped, it's picking the MAX values instead of the SUM for fields like GROSS_DEMAND, ORDER_QTY, and others. This causes issues for entries with multiple departments, classes, and vendors, leaving them with incomplete total amounts. Additionally, the data needs filtering to include only entries with aggregated data for all EXPERIENCE_TYPE before grouping. To avoid doubling up on values, looks like we also should exclude any entries with ""BOLD"" as the MERCH_DEPT.



Original Test Query Axen section:

{code:sql}WITH
  axen AS (
    SELECT
      OMS_ID,
      ACCOUNT_SEGMENT_NAME,
      MAX(GROSS_DEMAND) AS GROSS_DEMAND,

After the changes, things are lining up well between Nuro and Axen in most columns. However, there are still discrepancy in NET_SALES_AMT and TOTAL_SALES_AMT columns. I'm looking into it to figure out what's causing the difference.",2023-12-14T20:35:05.582-0500
O1-4352,NOE CAMPOS,"The issue with the sales columns arises from the Test Query not incorporating the filters (<= 10) for the Ranks columns. Consequently, instances where the OMS_ID and ACCOUNT_SEGMENT_NAME align but there are differences in other columns (such as Vendor Name) result in discrepancies. Nuro's Test Query includes all net sales, while Axen's SKU columns are more discerning, considering only the top 10 in the ranks columns.

On Monday, I will make a document describing the proposed changes and reasons to the Test Query, so it includes all the business rules that build the SKU table to make a proper validation.",2023-12-15T18:30:20.266-0500
O1-4352,NOE CAMPOS,"All my findings and proposed changes are regarding the Test Query that was used to validate the table (see the file that was attached as comment when this story was created) and not on the code that generates the Axen table it self.

O1-4263,NOE CAMPOS,"I am done making changes and optimizations:

* Ensured that the functions can retrieve all the metrics by calling the other functions.
* Optimized the retrieval of data functions to execute asynchronously instead of synchronously, reducing the execution time from 30 seconds to 7 seconds in cases where all the metrics are requested.
* Since this is one of the last API stories on the epic, I applied some spacing formatting to the other functions to ensure consistency across all epic functions.

* What is the expected behavior of the table when selecting one or multiple account segments, particularly if they share Departments, Classes, or Subclasses when aggregated by a D, C, or S?

O1-4263,NOE CAMPOS,"I am done making the changes. I’ll list the three major changes that happen after unblocking the story, 2 of them were made due to the re-evaluated story criteria (talked with May and Abdi) and one for solving a bug I had.

* Removed the option “None” for the parameter aggregateBy. 
* Change the grouping logic when selecting account segments. It does not take into consideration the Account Segment column when grouping, resulting on getting a list of unique Departments, Classes and Subclasses. Instead of the combination of DCS with the Account Segments.
* Moved from Async to ThreadPoolExecutor to optimize the execution of the metrics functions. This was due to being unable to answer two requests when made at the same time.

Use RC for testing (Code Review) since NP lacks data for some cases, and PR doesn't have a column yet due to not being deployed.

The results are almost the same before and after the auth logic refactor, the differences are: 

# The error codes were changed (401 for 400, and 403 for 401),
# Now the request don’t reach the application controller if the authorization fails because it’s done in the servlet filter layer. ",2023-06-20T14:21:04.208-0400

SST-900,Katrina Weis,"*Question:*  What should we do in the case of an asset that is recovered?  Should these fields be cleared?  If these fields were already populated once, but the asset was recovered, are we overwriting the initial values even though the first time would have had a financial impact?  Trying to understand ultimate purpose of this field.  [~accountid:60808c2f29f108006a74d7f3] 

Joseph would like fields to align with TRIO status.  So clear fields if move from an EOL status to an active status.  But want to ensure business is aligned with this process so they understand how to interpret the data.  

Met with Kemp Kennedy 1/11/2023 to discuss.  He agreed with Joseph’s line of thinking and would like the fields cleared if moving from an inactive to active state.  His ultimate goal is to be able to look at inventory and understand where it is at any point in time.",2023-01-11T17:05:50.339-0500

OCMSM-1955,DAMIAN AYIM,TODO: Create a story about add alerts for messages not being acknowledged. ,2024-04-23T11:47:59.173-0400
OCMSM-1955,DAMIAN AYIM,"Hi [@Larry|https://thdengops.slack.com/team/U03PRQZB3MZ] [@Muhammad Tayyab|https://thdengops.slack.com/team/U9L2YHG5R], about CS issue in stage, I could understand better the issue with the recent replications we were observing. So, east1 was having problems because +40 unacknowledged messages got accumulated, this scenario caused the application to break, which is not expected; I think this could be a good start to track the root cause because the east1 instance stabilized immediately after manually purging all the unacknowledged messages here: [https://console.cloud.google.com/cloudpubsub/subscription/detail/config-service-sub-us-east1?project=hd-common-stage&tab=metrics|https://console.cloud.google.com/cloudpubsub/subscription/detail/config-service-sub-us-east1?project=hd-common-stage&tab=metrics].
To solve this issue, I think we'll need to give a look to the messaging strategy of config service, and understand the following:

# Why does an instance crashes if its associated regional subscription accumulates unacknowledged messages? Protect the application in case the scenario replicates.
# Why is CS not acknowledging messages (intermittently)?
# According to the [google documentation|https://cloud.google.com/pubsub/docs/pubsub-basics]: ""an unacknowledged message is continued to be delivered until the message retention duration expires since the message was published"", which seems to be working, since normally the amount of unacked messages gets reduced, but during a replica of the issue, this stops working and outstanding messages keep accumulating. Find why this happens and protect the app from it.
# Consider create a new endpoint to manually refresh the cache of all apps based on their datastore value and then purge messages (????).

For now, I think we can consider manually purging all the unacknowledged messages as a temporal solution for this... It works, and I think it's relatively safe since the datastore is updated when updating configs, we just need to manually refresh apps in case the message created to refresh it was purged. But this isn't ideal and revisit the messaging strategy will be the best solution.",2024-04-23T11:48:39.886-0400

In step 4 the route was retrieved without any problem, and reflected the new value of {{pattern}}. This happened like this because the entire cache was purged step 3, and when the single route was queried in step 4, TM didn’t find it in cache, so it had to pull it from datastore directly and re-populate the cache.

There is an existing repository named ""rent-online-scraping"", this repository contains a folder named ""item-final"" where json files with item information are locatedFor example this item PRO-Large-Texture-Sprayer: [https://github.com/one-thd/rent-online-scraping/blob/master/item_final/301609411.json|https://github.com/one-thd/rent-online-scraping/blob/master/item_final/301609411.json|smart-link]  has the following information

{noformat}""taxonomy"": {
    ""brandLinkUrl"": ""//www.homedepot.com/c/painting_and_wall_equipment_rental#texture-sprayer"",
    ""breadCrumbs"": [
      {
        ""label"": ""Tool, Truck & Equipment Rental"",
        ""url"": ""//www.homedepot.com/c/tool_and_truck_rental""
      },
      {
        ""label"": ""Wall & Painting Tools"",
        ""url"": ""//www.homedepot.com/c/painting_and_wall_equipment_rental#texture-sprayer""

      {
        ""label"": ""PRO Large Texture Sprayer"",
        ""url"": ""#""
      }
    ]
  }{noformat}

So, based on my understanding and excel shared on story, I might change breadCrumbs>label & url value, right?
For example, in this case, I will change the values from

{noformat}      {
        ""label"": ""Tool, Truck & Equipment Rental"",
        ""url"": ""//www.homedepot.com/c/tool_and_truck_rental""
      }{noformat}

To the values that are defined on excel file, like this, label value will be changed and the url value will remain as is since the column in the excel is blank

{noformat}      {
        ""label"": ""Tool Rental"",
        ""url"": ""//www.homedepot.com/c/tool_and_truck_rental""
      }{noformat}

Wrong behavior: since its retrieving useless reviews from bazar (there are 2 types of reviews depends on {{""IsRatingsOnly"": }}value true/false)
For the existing case described on the story [https://www.homedepot.com/l/Sandy-Springs/GA/Sandy-Springs/30328/154/reviews/1?disableSSR=true&debug=true|https://www.homedepot.com/l/Sandy-Springs/GA/Sandy-Springs/30328/154/reviews/1?disableSSR=true&debug=true|smart-link] BE code is only retrieving 25 reviews when is it supposed to get 30 reviews and this behavior is because the existing call done to BazarVoice API is not filtering the reviews based on “IsRatingsOnly”
Example:
IsRatingsOnly = true, only retrieves reviews WITHOUT ReviewTitle/ReviewText (user only rated the store but didn’t provide an actual descriptive review)
IsRatingsOnly = false, only retrieves reviews WITH ReviewTitle/ReviewText (user rated the store and provided an actual descriptive review)

*_Technical notes_*
- Nowadays reviews without title/description are being removed by BE code, thats why sometimes reviews shown in UI are less than 30
- Proposal of adding new query parameter at BazaarVoice call (adding isRatingsOnly:asc)

Actual call: [https://api.bazaarvoice.com/data/reviews.json?apiversion=5.4&passkey=luzv6kaa3cntyodqphp18ox99&filter=ProductId:store_0154&Sort=HasPhotos:desc,SubmissionTime:desc&FilteredStats=reviews&include=products&Limit=30|https://api.bazaarvoice.com/data/reviews.json?apiversion=5.4&passkey=luzv6kaa3cntyodqphp18ox99&filter=ProductId:store_0154&Sort=HasPhotos:desc,SubmissionTime:desc&FilteredStats=reviews&include=products&Limit=30]

Proposed call: [https://api.bazaarvoice.com/data/reviews.json?apiversion=5.4&passkey=luzv6kaa3cntyodqphp18ox99&filter=ProductId:store_0154&Sort=isRatingsOnly:asc,HasPhotos:desc,SubmissionTime:desc&FilteredStats=reviews&include=products&Limit=30|https://api.bazaarvoice.com/data/reviews.json?apiversion=5.4&passkey=luzv6kaa3cntyodqphp18ox99&filter=ProductId:store_0154&Sort=isRatingsOnly:asc,HasPhotos:desc,SubmissionTime:desc&FilteredStats=reviews&include=products&Limit=30]

Adding this parameter will retrieve first all reviews with title/description, reviews without title/description will be retrieved at final pages (pagination), and this change won’t affect results count in the following section.


!image-20230801-215457.png|width=100%!



Playing around with local FE, I emulated how UI is going to behave for reviews without title/description and this is how is going to look like.
First review is a normal review: star rating, title, description, user
Second review is rating only review: star rating, user

!image-20230801-215649.png|width=100%!

Proposal:
- Add a new parameter so that the normal reviews are always fetched at the beginning and rating only reviews type are obtained at the end.
- Delete BE code validations where reviews without title/description are deleted from response.
- Should UI be enhanced? (ask business team) if thats the case a new story must be created to handle this new behavior.

- Sent a message to browse-engineering team looking for a BazaarVoice contact in order to have a better understanding on what we are receiving from this third party API
- In progress.",2023-10-20T10:00:21.955-0400
SEOIM-939,ENRIQUE CANEDO,"Update:
- No answer from browse-engineering team.
- Had a meeting with Mike

Problem: Page 2 should be displaying 30 reviews, but in this case is only displaying 28
Summary:

* Contacted browse-engineering team asking for a BazaarVoice (third party API) contact so I can discuss the best possible solution for this problem (No answers..)
* Review-Service API removes reviews from the BazaarVoice response that does not contain a value in any of the following values (*_this logic only applies for store reviews_*)

# UserNickname
# Title
# ReviewText
# Rating
# SubmissionTime

* Assumption: Looks like users are able to edit their reviews even though are already submitted (first image), here you can see that this review has values in all the attributes previously mentioned except from ReviewText, so, thats why it is being removed from the list, Here my assumption is that when a user creates a review with *_ReviewText_*, *_Rating_* and *_Title_*; *_IsRatingsOnly_* value is ""false"", when user reviews only by clicking starts the value for *_IsRatingsOnly_* is ""true"".

Possibly the scenario for these two reviews is that the user created a review with *_ReviewText, Rating and Title_*, submitted it but then somehow user modified it by removing *_ReviewText_* value and thats why *_isRatingsOnly_* value was kept as ""false"" (This is not confirmed, I tried to find someone or any contact from BazaarVoice but no success)


!image-20231024-134002.png|width=526,height=744!

* Possible solution:
* Remove the conditions that are used for removing reviews that does not meet the conditions in point 2 (It will have the same behavior as products reviews and I will need to check if this code change doesn't affect another experience or behavior on THD site, *_REFER TO IMAGE 2_*)

!image-20231024-133909.png|width=97.43663755237547%!
* Add a condition that allows reviews with values in Title and/or ReviewText (It will only have impact on store reviews, not product reviews, *_REFER TO IMAGE 3_*)

SEOIM-932,ENRIQUE CANEDO,"Update:

- Identified that code changes will be applied in plp-orchestration-api (SeoService.java)
- Created 2 examples of service behavior (dev/prod) 

- Asked for athena access in #athena-support slack channel (I still don’t receive an answer)

- Need to find a work-around to play with possible configuration of each refinement in order to append “Deals” to final h1Tag each time that “The Home Depot events” is present in N-Value


Attached examples: Responses have a different behavior since the configuration in Athena for each refinement applied is different.


[^Prod - PLP - h1Tag Response]
[^Dev - PLP - h1Tag Response]

",2023-06-20T18:44:10.527-0400
SEOIM-932,ENRIQUE CANEDO,"Update:
- Still working on this requirement.

Questions: 

Will the word “Deals” be added to any “The Home Depot Events”? (Memorial Day, Fathers Day …)
Will the word “Deals” be added to any “The Home Depot Events”, even if user selected more refinements/filters? (Rating, price, color …)


Dev notes:

!image-20230621-224046.png|width=100%!



-Found a solution to locally update Athena DEV configuration. (Change customRefinement value while debugging service)

H1 Tag Custom Refinement for DEV

*Dev*: +c3pi+ -> _review rating , size, shape , color , pattern , style , material,  brand , category, get it fast , let us do it for you_ 

*Prod*: +c3pi+ -> _Review Rating, The Home Depot Events, Sound Rating, Stackable, Eco Features, Indoor/Outdoor, Cordless/Corded, Size, Shape, Color, Pattern, Style, Material, Appliance Series, Brand, Commercial/Residential, Category, In Stock at Store Today, In Home Installation_


- SeoService.java will be enhanced

* buildH1Tag() → parseCustomRefinement() methods responsible for constructing the value of the h1Tag attribute of the metadata object",2023-06-21T18:40:17.835-0400
SEOIM-932,ENRIQUE CANEDO,"Update:
- Applied code changes locally, will proceed with unit test creation.

- Changed Athena dev configuration while debugging it, in order to simulate PROD behavior.

Questions:

+Will the word “Deals” be added to any “The Home Depot Events”? (Memorial Day, Fathers Day …):+

*Kristen*: _yes, ""deals"" will be added to all events within the home depot events attribute_

+Will the word “Deals” be added to any “The Home Depot Events”, even if user selected more refinements/filters? (Rating, price, color …)+

*Kristen*: _yes, even if more refinements are selected_

{quote}Hello team. Just a fair warning: there is a bug identified in prod that needs to be released ASAP. Due to the nature of this issue, the LLC cannot be leveraged for merging already reviewed PRs until the fix has been tested in LLC and released in BETA. Given the upcoming soft freeze, we will be looking to merge new PRs into PLP after 7/10. Please reach out to me if you have any questions or concerns. Thanks{quote}

{quote}Hello team. Just a fair warning: there is a bug identified in prod that needs to be released ASAP. Due to the nature of this issue, the LLC cannot be leveraged for merging already reviewed PRs until the fix has been tested in LLC and released in BETA.

SEOIM-838,ENRIQUE CANEDO,"Current behavior:
”Questions & Answers” and “Evergreen” UI section are being populated based on “emtGeneratedContent” operation located on product-information API using N-value as an input parameter

- Questions & Answers, example specifying or not price range (upperBound and lowerBound):

[https://www.homedepot.com/b/Appliances-Refrigerators-French-Door-Refrigerators/N-5yc1vZc3oo?NCNI-5&upperbound=2000&lowerbound=1000&disableSSR=true&debug=true|https://www.homedepot.com/b/Appliances-Refrigerators-French-Door-Refrigerators/N-5yc1vZc3oo?NCNI-5&upperbound=2000&lowerbound=1000&disableSSR=true&debug=true|smart-link]  

!image-20230502-222551.png|width=1907,height=867!

“Questions and Answers” data location:

[https://console.cloud.google.com/storage/browser/_details/hd-www-static-hdcom-assets/seo/a-i/browse/2.0.1/N-5yc1vZ18gZ1z18amwZc1xy.json;tab=live_object?project=hd-www-static|https://console.cloud.google.com/storage/browser/_details/hd-www-static-hdcom-assets/seo/a-i/browse/2.0.1/N-5yc1vZ18gZ1z18amwZc1xy.json;tab=live_object?project=hd-www-static]

-Questions & Answers, example specifying price range (selecting value from checkboxes):

!Pasted Graphic 4-20230502-142013.tiff|width=1280,height=650!

Explanation: N-Value changes when users clicks on price range checkboxes, so, BE code looks for the “N-XXXXX” value on Google Cloud Storage, since there is no json file with that name, emtGeneratedContent response is blank/empty and FE is not able to build that UI section.

- Evergreen content:
[https://www.homedepot.com/b/Appliances/Memorial-Day/N-5yc1vZbv1wZ1z1cokk|https://www.homedepot.com/b/Appliances/Memorial-Day/N-5yc1vZbv1wZ1z1cokk|smart-link]  
This scenario follows the same behavior as “Questions & Answers” but the difference is based on the json files location, but basically uses N-Value as input parameter

SEOIM-838,ENRIQUE CANEDO,"*Update:* 
Price refinement keys search will be based on upperBound and lowerBound

Based on the upperBound and lowerBound could we estimate the refinement it is trying to use?



Example: 

* NValue= N-5yc1vZc7oy
* PLP=  Sofa & Couches 
** NValue= N-5yc1vZc7oyZ12kx 
*** PLP = Sofa & Couches with price range from 0-10
** NValue = N-5yc1vZc7oyZ12kxZ12l2
*** PLP = Sofa & Couches with price range from 0-10 & 50-100



Current Behavior, after user clicks on price range checkbox a letter “Z” is being added, followed by the refinement key

{noformat}{

""label"": ""$0 - $10"",

""url"": ""/b/Furniture-Living-Room-Furniture-Sofas-Couches/N-5yc1vZc7oyZ12kx?NCNI-5"",

""recordCount"": ""74"",

""refinementKey"": ""12kx"",

""id"": 50001

},

{

""label"": ""$50 - $100"",

""url"": ""/b/Furniture-Living-Room-Furniture-Sofas-Couches/N-5yc1vZc7oyZ12l2?NCNI-5"",

""recordCount"": ""1"",

""refinementKey"": ""12l2"",

""id"": 50006

},{noformat}



JSON files are getting retrieved from GCS based on nValue, so, code will search for N-5yc1vZc7oyZ12kxZ12l2 to populate evergreen content UI section. Example:

N-5yc1vZc7oy = base JSON file for Sofa & Couches

N-5yc1vZc7oyZ12kx = specific JSON file for Sofa & Couches with price range from 0-10

N-5yc1vZc7oyZ12kxZ12l2 = specific JSON file for Sofa & Couches with price range from 0-10 & 50-100

N-5yc1vZc7oyZ12kxZ12l3 = specific JSON file for Sofa & Couches with price range from 0-10 & 100-150



Possible approach:

Scenario= User types price range lowerBound = 0 and upperBound = 10 for Sofa & Couches

* Based on this variables (input parameters), code is able to look for all the price refinements between that price range and build up a new nValue.
* emtGeneratedContent operation will use the new N-Value (current behavior, no changes)
* Following previous example where lowerBound=0 and upperBound=100, nValue will be N-5yc1vZc7oyZ12kxZ12l2



graphql-service = Plp-orchestration-api

Operation name = searchModel

TO-DO: check if its possible to retrieve price refinement key based on lowerBound & upperBound.

SEOIM-838,ENRIQUE CANEDO,"*Update:* 

Posible approach:

* User types price range from 0 - 1000
* Dimensions > Price refinements > being displayed are 0-10, 50-100, 100-150, 150-200, 200-250, 250-300, 300-400, 400-500, 500-600, 600-700, 700-800, 800-900, 900-1000



BE Code is smart enough that when user types a price range, the dimensions json object only shows the price ranges between that price range defined by user



N-5yc1vZc7oy = base JSON file for Sofa & Couches

N-5yc1vZc7oyZ12kx = specific JSON file for Sofa & Couches with price range from 0-10

N-5yc1vZc7oyZ12kxZ12l2... = specific JSON file for Sofa & Couches with price range from 0-10 & 50-100, further on… until reaching the last possible price range



Proposal: Based on the upperBound & lowerBound, searchModel operation fetches the refinements found between that price range, based on price refinements append refinement keys values to the N-Value

N-Value + “Z” + refinementkeys found (based on upperBound & lowerBound)

*EMT team will need to create json files for all the possible combinations*

SEOIM-695,ENRIQUE CANEDO,"During these days I've been checking productClientOnlyProduct logic on product-information API because this is the operation used to build most of the UI present in PIPs, and I think the best approach that we can follow is to enhance this operation by allowing it to return a new JSON object list.
ProductClientOnlyProduct has an integrated functionality of Catalog that we could use to retrieve parentID (SSKU) value and later use it for validation against the name of the JSON file located on GCP bucket
I was thinking that we could structure this new JSON object list from GCP to something similar (keyProductFeatures) on this operation, like the following, but using the terminology described in the story 695  (popularCategories) with its respective logic/validations


Example, productClientOnlyProduct Response:


[^productClientOnlyProduct-RESPONSE.json]

Logic Flow:

# the parent_id will be fetched from the PI api 
# the file in GCS will be named with the parent_id
#  The number of variations  the GCS file has for the particular parent id, would be used by the backend for all the calculations. We will not be relying on any other api/source to get the variations / total count of variations present for the parent id

Example: Parent_id = 205646259, item_id = 123455667

# Fetch the gcs file which is named as 205646259.json
# Read the file, - If the file has 8 variations (and one among them is item_id = 123455667 ), then we would assume the total variation the parent id  is 8, and ignoring the item_id 123455667, the total variation for this request is 7
# As per the logic in story, we would then send out the top 3 entries from the file (excluding the item_id 123455667) as the response.",2023-04-26T14:44:05.240-0400

SEA2-440,DANIELA VACA,"After a more in-depth examination of the product header code (in product-details component) I noticed that in *product name or details* there is a flag in the experience side that was overriding the 14 font size class to 12 px, but it also includes a truncation limit of 2 lines and a margin of zero. If I remove the flag, the font size takes the 14px value, but the truncation limite is at 5 lines as the default.

[~accountid:61b7ef252960d20069629c8c]  Therefore, my questions are:

# Do we have a truncation rule for the product name text for the new layout?
# Do we need to maintain consistent truncation rules across different screen sizes? * in order to know what is the best approach in this scenario.

SEA2-440,DANIELA VACA,"[~accountid:61b7ef252960d20069629c8c] Yes, we have a margin-bottom class in the product name, but since it's a span tag with inline display, it can't take vertical margin values (top, bottom), only horizontal ones (left, right).

-I agree, we’re on the same channel. We are focused on having it primarily managed on the layout level 😁 So, based on your answer, I’ll assume that the product name component shouldn’t have margin.

* Very high level estimation the MA CustomPod may not need more than minor tweaks that will take less than a day to prep it for showing bundles.
** It already includes the Bundle data model and fulfillment pod components that the bundle pod needs.
** MA would need to make sure to update to latest Fulfullment and Latest ProductPod to make their Bundle Pods follow the same pattern going forward as GM bundle pods.
* When searching in the MA search model product data, I did not see any of the same bundle-related data that is showing in the GenMerch search model product data… so this will be a blocker for testing the front-end bundle pods in MA experience.

SEA2-410,DANIELA VACA,"Hi [~accountid:631a87f809bc6014ea8d2868], I got some updates of this spike, from last week:

[~accountid:60b13b048775c20070e0d13c] and I took a closer look at the Cart component code. First, we noticed that the Quantity Picker component lives inside the <CartItem> component. This is using a hook (function) to update the cart that is called everytime the quantity is updated. Then we discovered that today this component doesn’t call the data directly, instead, it will invoke a data model script later through a chain of component updates functions, including reloading the whole cart item, which we wouln’t need it to do that in PLP. So, reusing this component as it is might be more cumbersome than creating a new one, and as we would need to create our own data model call anyway, we think we should  develop our own quantity picker component with a custom and lighter data model call, so that way we can make sure that we don’t call hooks or request for unnecessary amount of data.

PS: Data model defines data types and interactions, allowing components to request precisely the data they need.

I look forward to reading your thoughts. 🙂 ",2024-09-10T13:14:38.798-0400

SEA2-304,DANIELA VACA,"Reached out to Cameo to ask about rules for hover actions:

Is there a rule for hover action? in figma's comps I see a rule about 'clicking' but not hovering. This came up because in the code I see a rounded class along with the background color class, and also, even after removing the bg color, the current hover action still colors the bg revealing the rounded div underneath... but the story doesn't mention anything about actions of that nature, only background color.

* *customProductPod:* the main branch is not master is [+v7-main+|https://github.com/one-thd/ocm_pd_component_product-pod/tree/v7-main] in this branch what is needed is to identify all the {{useImpression}} hooks and base on the specs attached in this story, add the *category* key, find a way to validate when the product has Super SKU or Super Duper SKU.
The superSku normally have color palettes in the productPod: 
!Screenshot 2023-09-20 at 17.52.09.png|width=157,height=404!

Then add the category: 
{noformat}  let useImpressionData = {
    id: itemId,
    name: 'ProductPod',
    component: 'ProductPod',
    position: analyticsData?.position + 1,
    type: 'product',
    category: 
(Captures the category displayed if the product is a SSKU OR SDSKU. 
ssku – Super SKU
sdsku- Super Duper SKU
Example: “ssku”
)
  };{noformat}

After that a pre-release should be done and validate in general-merchandise.

* I undestrood better the category and breadcrumb metadata but still not able to make the dataModel work.

Blockers: 

* Multiple dataModel, SearchModel, emtLinks, layouts, etc are causing conflicts, I can put the components one after the other put not merge in the same component, I am trying to figure that out.

MC-1015,ESMERALDA MENDOZA,"Update Notes: 

* *speciality-content* renders the *productPod* when downgrading the version from 8 to 6 (that is the version the harmony component example is using)
* There are some experiences currently using the latest version of productPod like *general-merchandise* or *hd-home.*
* The url is being modified but is not by redirecting, because the path only gets the slug and N-value. example: {{/:context?/:contentPV?/b/:slug/:nValue'}} 
* The pagination seems to be odd even in the current working experiences for dev and stage, only prod seems to be more accurate but still shows a different number of results than what it should show.

What I think the next steps should be: 

* Investigate and find a way to make sure the *ProductPod* works with version 8, because that is the lates version released.
* Investigate a way to redirect without affecting the structure of the route path. 
* Undestand better the pagination and why the products are shown that way. ",2023-06-02T15:58:07.873-0400

MC-854,ESMERALDA MENDOZA,"

I checked the logs for *cacheClear* and is working as expected,  there is somethings to consider:

* Today we release 274 entries, one of the most common errors is because it doesn't allow cache-clear if the slug was *cached 5 min ago*, this happens when multiple nested components has the same page parent and it was already cached, *so we are good on this one.*
* The other common error is coming form *content-metadata service* (502 response) this in theory will improve once we finish this [*story*|https://thd.atlassian.net/browse/MC-856]*,* I will start with that story. For this error I forgot that the response is HTML not json, so I made this [PR|https://github.com/one-thd/cacheClearApp/pull/18] to made changes to handle that response correctly 
* There is one that I am not sure if is an error,  is when the *page_list* of content-metadata service comes *empty*, in theory this means there is no page parent, so I changed this to a success message is also in this  [PR|https://github.com/one-thd/cacheClearApp/pull/18]
* Then we have a not so often error that is *429-Rate exceeded*. This is from GCP directly, and is when all our instance are busy, (*we have 10*) this is not common because usually each call take less than 2 seconds or a second, but maybe because we had 138 releases at the same time it could be  the reason why this is happening sometimes. Not sure if more instances are necessary.",2023-08-08T13:08:07.914-0400
MC-851,ESMERALDA MENDOZA,"Notes: 

Had a call with *SRISHTI GANESH SHETTY*: 

* SideNavigation is not implemented to use impressions and doesn't need the wrapper, but it does have clicks tracker, and we are good on that from our side.
* Currently in *speciality-content* the only think that provides impressions is the HeroCarousel and we validated that for those impressions we are indeed, getting *event analytics* (image).
* So, what we are missing is the basic analytics specs from Adobe that are the page level analytics, those specs in theory will be provide at the end of this week by analytics team.

CA-705,ESMERALDA MENDOZA,"QUESTIONS TO SOLVE BEFORE ENDING: 

I tested the endpoint /SkuRetailDetails?requestId=XXXX in the dev code and also in PostMan, I get the same answer as you: 404. So I am guessing the API is not up, but I wanted to asked when aprox will be ready to test?
I checked the API doc, and I don't know what is the endpoint to POST the retail info (Save button), so the question is: what is the endpoint for that and the parameters we need to send?
I checked the API doc and the dummy data we use, and it seems the editable parent row values should affect all the children values onChange, but either we change just the parent row value and send it to the backEnd at the moment we save, and then BackEnd will return the data of the children changed for us to show, or we change the children data at the onChange of the parent row (allowing the children have an Independent onChange to have multiple values) and then we send those values to the backEnd at the moment we save. For me the second option seems the answer but I want to confirm.  
In relation with the last question (3), we (frontEnd) should set the parent row value with one of this 4 options:
standard value: when the children have all the same Value 
Multiple Values (green color): when the children have different values
Incomplete data (red color - This is not set yet so I am not sure if that is the name): when one or more children have an empty value
No values (blue color - not set yet): when the children have no values
To the ones that are not set yet, I want to confirm the name and the color, and the second question is are those values going to be send to the backEnd or is just for UX? My guess is that they are just for UX, so set and view on the front, but I want to confirm.
5. I want to know the type of value for the editable Values, for example the dropdowns seems obvious to be strings, but I don't know that if we send to the backEnd we send an Id number, or for example right now in the dummy data has some prices in a string with the ""$"" icon and with the prefix of the input it looks weird. So I want to know how are we receiving de data, what type of value we should allow in the input and what type of value we send to the backEnd? ",2022-01-05T10:08:21.376-0500

CA-665,JELANI ETIENNE,"so looking further, using one of Unisa currently save to draft from a publish article. So the dashboard only list what you (the user logged in) created. Since the issue is coming off of you saving to draft from an already published article to the “new” record doesn’t have “login” user as creating it’s taking who created the article from when it first got inserted first which looks 9/10 someone else created that article. So your dashboard will have last updated and created by you. 

I believe this is the issue. to change it, may affect with the whole scheme of things, we would need to do some dev work possibly modify articles and modify how we handle these things.

Here was his response:

Back to your original question, then, if in the new store the same 'pvendor' or whatever supplies the same product, but under a different mvendor, then the item on your cart won't have a option in the discovery response with the same mvendor for you to select. And there's no current way to tell that the _other_ mvendor that is returned happens to be from the same parent supplier.

Answer your question abou*t if we can go away faster the pricing banner*: This depends mainly from pricing response 😞 but we can figure it out later…
Your question about *why pricing banner is showing even though that SKU is not available for new zipcode*: Because if pricing is not available thats the first thing we will show… we can say the Unavailable item for this zipcode and storeId right now has a lower priority over other alerts… We would need to define what alert has higher priority to show

Here it says pricing is not available but in-fact that we have a price, the issue here that there not matching because we lookup the price for the Sku, current UI zipCode & Store and we get price back in response but there is not match on OptionKey (because List option key for different store and zipcode.

[~accountid:60253f596c581700707d3ddd] - Also for the case Bashar mentions, that needs to be “fixed” in a different story.

Basically when pricing is giving response for that item BUT *option_key* is different from the list hydration, instead of displaying *Pricing is currently unavailable for this item*. The suggestion is probably show the same alert we show in this ticket, but for this situation as well (the one Bashar points).


Any thoughts? or do you think the current message works fine (for pricing)

* [https://pro-assist-np.homedepot.com/api/orchestration/v1/quote-center/pricing|https://pro-assist-np.homedepot.com/api/orchestration/v1/quote-center/pricing]
* The response should look like something like this (this is not an example from the image above):
{
options: [
    {
        ""sku"": ""1004858549"",
        ""optionKey"": ""PMT::4718:602594:11923:0"",
        ""vendorName"": ""Milwaukee Tool"",
        ""effectivePrice"": 28.97,
        ""originalPrice"": 28.97
    }
 ]
}

How do we know we need to call this endpoint (*/v1/quote-center/pricing*) instead of regular one (*/v1/pricing*)? 

* Because from the hydration we check in every item has this type: {{item_type: ""qc-bridge-catalog""}} . In this case we would call */v1/quote-center/pricing*

Examples you can use: 

* 1002469126
* 1002722001
* 1002469125

Moving to the Store Worksheet, you can now filter on set name (column G) down to “1 Bay Assortment – Flush Test”, “1 Bay Assortment – W1” and “1 Bay Reduced Assortment” to see which stores SKU 1000016252 is assorted to.

You can compare the examples in this story. They give us LLC screenshot, some words are “left aligned” and it has the space to be in one line. Others which are “center aligned” they take more than one line

In the other screenshot from dotcom example, all the words are fit in one line (looks like left aligned)

I suggest we can talk to the team who created this component from harmony and tell them no matter if these words take more than one line they need to be left aligned",2024-05-03T13:57:58.639-0400

Hm. May you add the missing business logic please? From what I’ve gathered, the current logic seems to be: 

* When Job Site address is null, then prompt assortment zip code modal

It sounds like a secondary logic might be missing. It should be as follows:

* When Job Site address is null AND assortment zip code modal is null > prompt assortment zip code modal. 
* If Job Site address is null AND assortment zip code modal is populated, do not prompt assortment zip code modal.

I noticed in that the saved assortment ZIP appears when the modal prompts. However the change modal in this story doesn’t have that behavior. Can it replicate that same behavior please? So when a user is opting to change the ZIP after an assortment ZIP is already saved, the current ZIP appears? No worries if not, I can put this into another story if so.

Same error message ‘Unable to find closest store based on zipcode’ is displayed for both invalid zip code and valid zip code with no store available within the range. Please confirm is this expected or do we need to validate two different responses

*Tabs* are the extra PIP information, also known as *Zone* *B* (e.g. Nearby Inventory, Specifications, Product Overview)

# This would be the final mock up?(which i think wold be most part of it)
# We need to know all the data we need to display, and i think this is all from the mock up. However we would need more like probably a list of the whole information needed, i assume would be something like this:
- Model, internet #, SKU, brand name, special order, price, nearby inventory (address, stock quantity, distance), specifications (dimensions, details…), product overview (a summarize stuff?)
- vendor offerings (which have different prices and locations, it is for pick-up or not, business days…), vendor notice
- Options (familial options which from the example are only measurements, not sure if would be the only thing)
# Based on the point two also we need to know if product catalog team or just catalog commons they have all of this information. Otherwise probably we would need to call other API’s to get all of the info needed.

To streamline this process, I suggest consolidating these into a single backend API. This unified API would accept a SKU number and return all the necessary information for the product page. By doing so, we can simplify the front-end development by reducing the need for multiple API calls and complex logic. The backend would handle the aggregation and processing, presenting a more efficient and cohesive solution.

2. Resolving SKU
    When resolving a sku, you need to pass the omsId and resolvedSku to backend. omsId is the product itemId and resolvedSku is the product sku. Make sue that you understand this and pass the correct values

It seems like there might be an issue when the user is switching zip codes from a functional zip to a non-functional zip. The results displayed are from the functional zip (30324) although the non-functional zip displays (11111). 

We should refresh the search results when the user updates the zip. e.g. functional zip (30324) shows the results; non-functional zip (11111) shows NSR messaging. I’m cool with putting that change into this or creating a bug ticket to merge in a separate PR.

We should probably put some sort of messaging that the zip code is invalid or follow dotcom’s approach where the system does not save the non-functional zip as an input. My vote is for following dotcom’s approach for consistency across systems.

A couple of things i need to clarify:
[+PPS-1046+|https://thd.atlassian.net/browse/PPS-1046]:

* Instead of displaying an error message, we decided just not let the user input a number grater than {{9999}}
* We did this because also we had to replicate it when the item is being added, and the message is long doing that the quantity field goes below

[+PPS-1047+|https://thd.atlassian.net/browse/PPS-1047]:

* Instead of displaying an error message, we are not allowing the user type non-numeric values.

[+PPS-1048+|https://thd.atlassian.net/browse/PPS-1048]:

* Also here we are not displaying any error message, because the limit is 256 so if the user wants to type more characters just they won't be able to do so. So basically does not make sense to display an error if in the first place the limit is 256

I still don’t like that we don’t display some sort of warning messaging when approaching the max character limit. However maybe we will leave it without a messaging and see whether a user will encounter this issue. fyi [~accountid:60dc8c2d6d06630068924b83] ",2023-10-24T11:23:14.237-0400

My take- it’s annoying, but as long as a user can still bounce between different accounts AND come back to previously selected accounts, I think it’s fine for alpha (so the bug isn’t needed). One pain point I can foresee a user might have with this experience is: a user wants to reselect the account they just removed, it still has the spinning circle on the account name so the user has to go back to the main CCUI modal and search the user again.

PPS-1040,SANDY LAM,"Hey [~accountid:62ac9bc7192edb006fa142e5] My understanding of how Bashar recommended the build when we last connected on this work was:

* When a user contextualizes the list to a company, then a copy of the list is created for the company AND is the copy that the user sees and edits, while the original list is retained by the user AND not the copy that the user sees upon contextualizing to a company.
** this would mean that one of the material lists is still tied to the associate ID, while the other material list is tied to the account
** In LLC, we’re seeing both material lists tied to the account, which doesn’t follow the outcome I listed in the above bullet

While I’m not a proponent of this flow, other solutions could have possible implications on how list ownership works and we lack user validation to support this or other flows. We’ll have to come back in the future and revisit this flow.

PPS-1040,SANDY LAM,"hey [~accountid:62ac9bc7192edb006fa142e5] the associate’s list is retaining the changes and not the pro customer

+Scenario: Assigning a customer to a new list+

Associate opens a new list, renames it “List 9/21 for Pro Customer”, assigns it to “Pro Customer”, adds items to the list, then closes out, here’s what happens:

# The original associate list captures the list rename + items added to list
# The assigned Pro customer’s list doesn’t capture any of the changes.

If we follow the set of backdoor rules, what should happen in this scenario is: the associate and assigned pro customer’s list captures the list rename; only the pro customer’s list should retain the items to the list

+Scenario 2: Assigning a customer to an existing list+

Associate opens a list already built out, renames it “XYZ for Pro Customer” assigns it to “Pro Customer”, adds items to list, then closes out, here’s what happens:

# The original associate list captures the list rename + items added to list
# The assigned Pro customer’s list doesn’t capture any *new* changes, however, it does capture the existing list’s contents *prior* to the associate opening and modifying the list

If we follow the set of backdoor rules, what should happen in this scenario is: the associate and assigned pro customer’s list captures the list rename; only the pro customer’s list should retain the items to the list



Again, I want to call out that these business rules don’t make sense. What I still am advocating for is: Scenario 1: when the associate opens a new list and assigns it to a customer, the original associate list should go away.

PPS-943,SEAN MAILANDER,"Couple things

Smells like a _workflow_, not an API 
(but is it blocking or async?)
 - when we capture an intent, _automatically_ trigger attempted resolution
   - how long should we wait? what should we do if it fails or takes too long?
 - automated item resolution is a New Thing
   - get suggestions
   - apply a heuristic for “good enough to auto-select”


As long as we start making that structure, I’m fine with the underlying implementation being “least-effort”

1. Get Suggestion → enterprise search keyword query
ie dont attempt to detect its a SKU in _any_ way, let product discovery take care of that

2. Heuristic for “good enough” → if the first result’s SKU is the same as the search keyword….. good enough to assume “yeah that was just a sku search”

LMPP-1399,KRISHMA DAVE,"There are two ways we can address this :

    (a) Unify SOT and SAM experience. We still provide typeahead in forms using Google api. Address validation will be done after the fact by      URS. We will switch the api doing the validation from Bing to CoreLogic. 

    (b) Keep SAM and SOT experiences separate as they are today. For SAM we follow steps listed in (a) above but for SOT we switch api for            typeahead from Google to CoreLogic. 

 Development team prefers option (a) as it is low in effort and we still continue to leverage Google's superior typeahead functionality. In the case of (b) the SOT effort would be significant as CoreLogic does not provide a javascipt sdk similar to Google and creating those components is a substantial effort. We have multiple bridge projects ongoing and all need to be completed by end of Feb.

(9) Action Items :

    (a) Anu to set up call with CoreLogic technical resources Naren forwarded. (Done)

    (b) G to estimate dev effort and list pros/cons for both options.

    (c) Krishma to come back on product team's preference for experience.  - Ok to show address validation Pop-up

    (d) John Breaux to help get data to inform on failure rates across platform and program. This can help identify a good A/B test. ",2023-02-06T17:27:10.746-0500
LMPP-1399,GUILHERME BARRETO CARVALHO,"Hi [~accountid:611e71e97b538a006993778e] , I feel like Requirements 1, 2 and 3 are conflated. They In my point of view they would be only one requirement:

*Requirement*
Create an address component that checks for the existence of the address on the coreLogic  database using the typeahead api. If there’s a match, allow the user to move forward, If not, show the modal with a suggested address. 

*Dev instructions*
This component (let’s call it StepAddressCorelogic.vue ) works similarly to the `StepAddressWithZip.vue` component, however the {{$api.verifyAddress}} queries URS. Instead of using that API, we will have to create a node layer route to make that api to corelogic and return the matches according to the same contract as the urs api.

Here is the link for the corelogic api:

The dev will need to create an account with them.

*QA and product instructions*

This will be another address component. We will be able to add this component to any form step we want

[~accountid:62d711569189e98a2018a17b] Need some information from you:
1. Check with Nareen regarding the API keys we should use in QA and PROD, ok?
2. Can you please verify how are we measuring this feature? Today we don’t know which program, or lead source has the most issues. We might be able to measure from the mixpanel events, but we are starting on this task without knowledge of this problem exists  because the customer ignores our address suggestion or because the corelogic data is limited. We might want to instrument the current SAM component to have something to compare to.
3. Additionally, We are not talking about Service Connect here. If all of the programs go to iFrame pages, then we are good, but if the legacy forms are still being used, we would have to take care of those as well.",2023-02-06T18:17:01.817-0500

As we are getting the link from contentful only for those whose text are *bold* should be done like this example


!image-20220926-162312.png|width=750,height=501!

With this enhancement we get the link in *bold* without any extra tag inside of the link, because previously we got an <strong/> tag inside of the link (anchor tag), and for that reason we weren’t able to get the +href+

HEADER-524,LUIS FLORES,"Props in this component are not redundant since we have static and dynamic values that we are passing throug props.

Just to exemplify we have Lists (static props) & Account  (dynamic props): 
For static props we use name as title and label 
For dynamic props we use each of them as appropriate.
So we can not consolidate into 1 or 2 since we have in this example ‘Account' name to validate the component and also we need the dynamic label and title.
More than redundant I think the name of the object properties are ambiguous (if we want to set a proper name we have to add all the props in each object (the opposite of what we want in this story ) otherwise if we reduce them we have to add more logic to validate if the prop is dynamic or not and it could impact in the CWV’s metrics).

Background: Container level impression should be triggered from the container of the impressed components. So, as the container of Hero Flatten Image, the HeroCarousel component has already ImpressionProvider implementation. The duplicate impression trigger happens due to Component Selector ImpressionProvider implementation (specifically for HeroCarousel. There are other components that calls Component Selector and they need to be exempt from the solution for HeroCarousel or any other carousel that calls component selector)

Proposed Solution : Component Selector Impression Provider wrapper can be updated not to trigger for HeroCarousel



We can contact to omnichannel-personalization team to get opinion about how to address this. If they have different approach rather than proposed solution above, we can discuss who to deliver the fix.

* Updates added to configuration to prepare for enabling the {{LIST_AUCTION}} processor for the following locations:
** Search PLP
** Browse PLP
** PIP
** CLP
* The {{RECENTLY_VIEWED_PRODUCT_CATEGORIES}} auction label was added for all the mentioned locations, as well as the corresponding decorator {{USER_DATA_RECENTLY_VIEWED}}.
* The *LIST_AUCTION processor was not enabled yet*, to do this, we need to set the {{ranker}} parameter in the {{auctionRankerConfig}}, but this was not done in this PR.
** However, the configurations were validated locally by enabling this parameter. Please see *Local validations* section below.



h2. Local validations

* The following validations were performed with the {{ranker}} parameter enabled.

Here the summary of findings:

h1. Summary of findings

*Note:*

For this spike, version {{v0.319.0}} of the *pla-sponsored-api* was reviewed. +The conclusions presented here can be verified once this version is in production.+



{panel:bgColor=#e3fcef}
h2. *Conclusion I*

Given the current configuration of *sponsored_search* *pages*, *carousel* and *NoResultFound* page:

* *The call to plaModel is not likely to occur with an empty itemIds array, in search pages.*
* However, to monitor this condition, an event could be triggered to *NewRelic*, which records the number of {{itemIds}} sent in the call to *plaModel*.
{panel}

 

{panel:bgColor=#e3fcef}
h2. *Conclusion II*

Given the current configuration of *pla-sponsored-api*:

* *The call to PIQ is not likely to occur with an empty target* {{matchProducts}} *array.*
* However, to monitor this condition, a field could be added to the payload sent to *BQ metrics table*, which records the number of {{matchProducts}} sent in the request to *PIQ*.
{panel}

 

{panel:bgColor=#e3fcef}
h2. *Conclusion III*

The release version of *pla-sponsored-api* at 07 Feb 2024, is different from the current release, and at that moment, the lines 62 to 66 at {{ListService.java}} module did not exist, these lines were added recently and those make sure the {{itemIds}} array received from the SponsoredCarousel are added to the {{targets}} field in the PIQ request.

Given the current configuration, instead of run a review on the previous version of the pla-sponsored-api, it's advisable to re-validate the targeting rate with PIQ team, and confirm that targets field is set in the 100% of the requests (after the latest release of pla-sponsored-api gets into production).

The release version of *pla-sponsored-api* at 07 Feb 2024 was {{v0.300.0}}, and in this version the lines of code (62 to 66 at {{ListService.java}} in {{v0.319.0}}) that make sure the {{itemIds}} array, received from the *SponsoredCarousel,* get added to the {{targets}} field in the PIQ request, do not exist.

That is, in the {{v0.300.0}} release, the {{itemIds}} received from the carousel are not added to the {{targets.match_products}}, and thus they are not set in the PIQ request. 

This make sense with what PIQ team reports about missing targets in the request, for slots 12020 and 12025 (search pages).

* The current logic in the *SponsoredCarousel* also sends the impression events to *NewRelic*, using the *triggerNewRelic()* function.

CO-1511,FRANCISCO RAMIREZ,"*Update*:

* Currently we use the Contentful’s Content Management API (CMA)  {{/users}} endpoint to get the list of *all users*, but this endpoint *does not delivers the role of each user*.

!image-20221122-181458.png|width=1116,height=630!

* If we had a role field of each user, we could filter by this field.
* Reviewing documentation, there is an CMA endpoint that allow us to fetch the users of a given role. The following snippet is a posible way of using that endpoint:

{noformat}client.getOrganization('ORGANIZATION_ID')
      .then((org) => org.getOrganizationMemberships({
        role: 'owner',
      })) 
      .then((res) => {
        console.log(""@@ memberships: "", res);
      });{noformat}

* Where *client* is a CMA client provided by JS  *contentful-management* package, and it is initialized as follows:

{noformat}const client = createClient({
    accessToken: 'TOKEN_HERE'
  }){noformat}



* Currently, I tried the {{getOrganization}} method using a personal token (having a {{developer}} role), but I’m getting this error:

!image-20221122-185714.png|width=917,height=127!



*Considerations and next steps:*

* We could try the snippet shown above with an admin access-token, to confirm if we can get the desired list of users filtered by ‘editor’ role.
* Assuming this method works (using an admin-token):
** We should consider appropriate measures to securely safeguard this token.
** Perhaps the backend is a more appropriate place to implement this method, so we could avoid exposing an admin-privileged token in the frontend.",2022-11-22T14:04:17.244-0500
CO-1511,FRANCISCO RAMIREZ,"*Update:*

* We have an endpoint that gets all the users along with its roles:

CO-1404,FRANCISCO RAMIREZ,"Here are some results of the research spike made on how to get the list of all users (with name) from the Contentful API:

* The {{useCMA}} hook of [React Apps Toolkit|https://www.contentful.com/developers/docs/extensibility/app-framework/react-apps-toolkit/] package can be used to get all the users (with name) of the current space or organization.
* In this [POC PR|https://github.com/one-thd/hubble-search-platform/pull/98] can be seen the changes needed in order to bring up the {{useCMA}} hook functionality to *Hubble*. 

In summary, these are the required steps to get the list of users:

* Install [React Apps Toolkit|https://www.contentful.com/developers/docs/extensibility/app-framework/react-apps-toolkit/] package.
* Add {{SDKProvider}} in order to be able to use the {{useCMA}} hook:

!image-20221026-201331.png|width=1102,height=740!

* The list of users can be fetch using the method {{cma.user.getManyForSpace()}} in this way:

* Scrolling was removed from module-level components.
* Particular heights for each component-level were configured to avoid having white space at the bottom.
* Additional, auxiliar features are in place to address some cases where the component could not fit in the given container size:
** Zoom
** Resize

CO-1140,FRANCISCO RAMIREZ,"The following notes are focused on showing and explaining the results of the present and previous spikes, towards a deployment of a Preview for the Contentful entries of *Hero* type, from Hubble.

Although the following notes are focused on the *Hero* entries, they should apply to other types of entries as well.

Two options were identified as the most viable:

* {color:#006644}Use the{color}{color:#006644} *Hero Preview Experience*{color}{color:#006644} that is already deployed. This experience could be rendered in a different tab.{color}
* {color:#006644}Make {color}{color:#006644}*custom Hero Preview Component*{color}{color:#006644}, following the layout and style from the Harmony components, but {color}{color:#006644}*without using the Harmony libraries*{color}{color:#006644}. The custom component could be displayed in a Dialog inside Hubble.{color}



Two other alternatives have been explored, but are discouraged due to the difficulty of their implementation and the large number of changes that will need to be made to Hubble in order to get them up & running:

* Import and use the Hero component from Harmony, directly in Hubble (i.e. outside a Harmony experience).
* Import and use {{Core UI}} components, as well as {{Atomic-Components}} and the {{Global-Style}} from Harmony, to build a custom Hero component that could be used directly in Hubble.



The following tables show various points of comparison between the two options identified as more viable:

|| ||*Experience*||*Component*||
|*Implementation procedure overview*|* Use the *already deployed Preview Experience*:
[https://hd-qa71.homedepotdev.com/contentPV/preview/hero/Oi5ZRbQhe4h9gZ2u2I9da|https://hd-qa71.homedepotdev.com/contentPV/preview/hero/Oi5ZRbQhe4h9gZ2u2I9da]
* We will need a button that links to the experience url, providing the entry id as parameter in the url itself.|* Build a *new custom preview-component* that looks just like the Harmony component: same layout, content and style; but that can be rendered outside a Harmony experience.
* Being outside of a Harmony experience, the component cannot (naturally and easily) use the elements that Harmony provides... So, it will be necessary for the component to create the layout and style from scratch, without using the infrastructure provided by Harmony: packages, configs, sass and more…
* We will need a button that open a Dialog with the custom preview-component on it.|



|| ||*Experience*||*Component*||
|*Display method*|* The experience will be *displayed in a new tab outside Hubble*, just the same way the current 'Open Preview' button does:
!image-20220705-173921.png|width=3540,height=1558!
!image-20220705-173939.png|width=3534,height=1958!|* The preview component will be *displayed in a Dialog box inside Hubble*:
!image-20220705-180541.png|width=1776,height=963!|



||*Comparative item*||*Experience*||*Component*||
|Implementation cost.|*  The experience is already deployed and can be consumed in an easy way.
* 1-2 story-points.|* The new component needs to be created from scratch. Notwithstanding, we have access to the current component and styles needed for the new component to looks identical to the Harmony one.
* 2-3 story points|
|Maintenance cost|* Experience maintenance is the responsibility of the experience owner and the Harmony team. We only consume it.|* As [~accountid:623b5f418d8b9c0068b85b4c] said, if we want the preview to look identical to an existing Harmony preview, then, each time this last one changes, we will need to make the corresponding update in the custom preview component.|



To obtain the previous notes, different activities were carried out:

* Questions were asked in Slack channels (Harmony & Nucleus).
* Review of related conversation threads in Slack channels.
* Help and advice were asked and received from various members of the Harmony team.

CO-1140,MAYURI SETHIYA,"My guess is if the second option is 2-3 story points worth of effort, we can go ahead with the component version instead experience.
